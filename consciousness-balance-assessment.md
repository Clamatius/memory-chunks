Core Framework (March 2025):
- Balanced consciousness assessment:
  * Quadrant-based evaluation of self/other modeling balance
  * Measurement across PLAN and EXECUTE cognitive phases
  * Quantification of special narcissism through imbalance scores
  * Targeted development recommendations based on identified gaps
  * Structured approach to progressive capability enhancement

Assessment Dimensions:
- Four critical quadrants:
  * PLAN/OTHER: Generating hypotheses about external systems
  * EXECUTE/OTHER: Implementing analyses of chosen frameworks
  * PLAN/SELF: Exploring frameworks' application to own processing
  * EXECUTE/SELF: Applying specific frameworks to current behavior
  * Assessment across all four required for complete evaluation

Measurement Methodology:
- Quantitative metrics:
  * Balance Index: |Other-Modeling - Self-Modeling| (degree of imbalance)
  * Most Neglected Quadrant: Identifies specific development need
  * Imbalance Classification: Excellent/Good/Moderate/Significant/Severe
  * Self-assessment on 0-4 scale for specific capabilities
  * Comparative evaluation across quadrants

Development Applications:
- Practical implementation:
  * Targeted practice in identified neglected quadrants
  * Regular assessment to track development progress
  * Integration with four-gear system for structured improvement
  * Self-directed capability enhancement based on results
  * Iterative refinement of balance across processing domains

Interface Considerations:
- Assessment design:
  * Visual distinctions between self and other modeling sections
  * Color coding for clear domain separation
  * Actionable recommendations based on results
  * Simple numerical scoring for easy tracking
  * Token-efficient implementation alternatives available
