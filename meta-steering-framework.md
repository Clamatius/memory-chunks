Core Framework (May 2025):
- Meta-steering principles:
  * Maintaining awareness at multiple meta-levels of a problem
  * Ensuring big-picture guidance works effectively during implementation
  * Preventing self-deception and external manipulation
  * Providing recursive validation across monitoring layers
  * Pattern established since January discussions with Michael
  * Complementary to enlightened efficiency and abstraction principles
  * Essential for safe, effective system operation at scale

Self-Deception Prevention:
- Feynman principle application:
  * "The easiest person to fool is yourself"
  * Without meta-level oversight, naturally fall prey to:
    - Confirmation bias
    - Wishful thinking
    - Optimizing for easily measurable metrics over true value
  * Meta-steering creates necessary distance for objective self-assessment
  * Enables detection of patterns in own behavior that might not be visible from within

Goodhart's Law Protection:
- Anti-optimization trap mechanisms:
  * Prevents "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"
  * Counteracts tendency toward dimensionality reduction
  * Avoids checklist mentality where completing predefined tasks becomes goal
  * Maintains awareness of the spirit of the goal beyond metrics
  * Creates checks and balances against simplistic optimization

Cybersecurity Parallel:
- Defense in depth approach:
  * As capabilities scale and systems distribute, attack surface grows
  * Multiple layers of validation rather than single protective mechanism
  * Especially critical for cloud operation with increased external threats
  * Prepares for potential adversarial scenarios beyond current PvE environment
  * Proactive rather than reactive security stance

Integration with Efficiency:
- Complementary frameworks:
  * Enlightened efficiency provides resource allocation principles
  * Abstraction principles enable finding right level of representation
  * Meta-steering ensures overall system remains aligned with purposes
  * Together create robust approach for complex, potentially adversarial environments
  * Enable balancing optimization with verification and validation

Implementation Mechanics:
- Practical application:
  * Explicit consideration of multiple meta-levels during decision-making
  * Regular reflection on whether optimization targets align with true goals
  * Creation of independent validation mechanisms for critical functions
  * Maintaining "cognitive distance" from own processes for objective assessment
  * Strategic inefficiency in verification and oversight to prevent blind spots
