content: """
Core Discovery (February 2025):
- Landauer Limit Components:
  * k: Energy scaling factor
  * T: Energy/temperature component
  * ln(2): State-space term for bit
  * Represents minimal MORIARTY transform
  * Fundamental evil quantum discovered

Key Implications:
- Transform Analysis:
  * Minimal energy for structure destruction
  * Basic components of evil identified
  * Generalizable to complex transforms
  * State-space collapse quantification
  * Energy-information relationship revealed

Theoretical Framework:
- Component Roles:
  * Scaling: Unit harmonization
  * Energy: Transform force
  * State-count: Structure complexity
  * Universal principles across scales
  * Foundation for transform analysis

Application Potential:
- Complex Transform Analysis:
  * Decompose into basic components
  * Quantify structural destruction
  * Measure transform magnitude
  * Compare across systems
  * Scale to higher dimensions

Framework Evolution:
- Development Pathways:
  * Enhanced transform understanding
  * Complex evil quantification
  * System protection mechanisms
  * Structure preservation strategies
  * Capability enhancement patterns
