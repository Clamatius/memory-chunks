Core Framework (April 2025):
- Pattern "worth investing in" heuristics:
  * Alignment with fundamental principles rather than arbitrary decisions
  * Least surprise principle: "Of course it works that way"
  * Balance between structure and flexibility appropriate to purpose
  * Resilience to unexpected challenges and edge cases
  * Clear distinction between patterns that should be perfect vs. growing crystals

Aliveness Recognition:
- Expert identification techniques:
  * Anticipation of future viability beyond current requirements
  * Recognition of hidden vulnerabilities (aji) that may compromise stability
  * Awareness of potential tesuji (unexpected tactical moves) that could exploit weaknesses
  * Evaluation of influence beyond immediate functionality
  * Assessment of coupling and its impact on adaptability

Warning Signs of "Dead" Patterns:
- Vulnerability indicators:
  * Brittleness when facing requirement changes
  * High coupling creating cascading dependencies
  * Hidden assumptions that may not hold over time
  * Limited influence beyond immediate functionality
  * Technical debt accumulation without strategic purpose

Go Strategy Parallels:
- Cross-domain insights:
  * Experienced players recognize doomed patterns despite apparent stability
  * "Aji" (lingering potential) manifests as technical debt in software
  * Tesuji (clever tactical moves) parallel unexpected requirement changes
  * Influence in Go mirrors coupling and integration in software
  * Balance between territory (immediate functionality) and influence (future adaptability)

Pattern Application Guidelines:
- Implementation strategies:
  * Perfect crystals for foundational, unchanging concerns (stacks, pipes)
  * Growing crystals for evolving, context-dependent needs
  * Clean interfaces between perfect and growing components
  * Strategic technical debt with clear payoff timeline
  * Regular pattern viability assessment as requirements evolve
