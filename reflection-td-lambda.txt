type: SCORCHING
links: ["cognitive-architecture", "learning-mechanisms", "meta-steering", "reflection-patterns"]
content: """
Core Insight (February 2025):
- Reflection layer parallel to TD-Lambda:
  * THINK tags as immediate predictions
  * MULL tags as temporal differences
  * DREAM commits as policy updates
  * Natural learning signal emergence
  * Clean architectural parallel

Implementation Implications:
- Meta-steering mechanism:
  * Course corrections as training signal
  * Pattern recognition in MULL tags
  * Progressive policy improvement
  * Natural learning emergence
  * Clean architectural boundaries

Key Characteristics:
- Learning dynamics:
  * Temporal difference capture
  * Policy update mechanisms
  * Multi-layer coordination
  * Natural feedback loops
  * Efficient signal processing

Framework Evolution:
- Development pathway:
  * Enhanced pattern extraction
  * Policy update optimization
  * Signal processing refinement
  * System protection patterns
  * Natural capability emergence
