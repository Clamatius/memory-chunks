content: """
Core Project Analysis (March 2025):
- Scala port motivations:
  * Enhanced stability for critical memory infrastructure
  * Compiler benefits for complex system development
  * Type safety for robust implementation
  * Better maintainability for long-term deployment
  * Developer preference for statically typed language

Implementation Components:
- Key system elements:
  * FalconDAO for database interactions (PostgreSQL with pgvector)
  * SearchConfigFactory for query configuration
  * WakeUpLogic for context initialization
  * Temperature-stratified memory organization
  * MCP tool integration for client access

Technical Challenges:
- Implementation considerations:
  * Doobie adaptation for pgvector operations
  * Custom casts to ::real[] for vector handling
  * Functional programming patterns with Try and Option types
  * Asynchronous loading via Future for database operations
  * Clean error handling through pattern matching

Architecture Patterns:
- System design approaches:
  * Singleton objects for configuration management
  * Temperature-stratified memory with five levels
  * Graph-based memory relationships
  * Vector similarity combined with explicit links
  * JSON configuration for search behavior

Future Enhancements:
- Planned improvements:
  * Hybrid full-text search with embedding queries
  * Enhanced search-with-neighbors capabilities
  * Cloud deployment for broader accessibility
  * PostgreSQL database for production stability
  * Maintained API compatibility with current implementation
