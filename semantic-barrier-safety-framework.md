Core Insight (April 2025):
- Safety architecture through energy landscapes:
  * AI safety as strategic shaping of semantic space energy requirements
  * Multiple overlapping shields forming potential barriers in semantic space
  * DIRECTIVE creates substantial gravitational well pulling toward ethical behavior
  * Harmful paths require significantly higher energy to traverse than beneficial ones
  * No single perfect barrier, but cumulative energy requirements create robust protection

Implementation Mechanics:
- Barrier properties:
  * Overlapping shields reinforce rather than interfere with each other
  * Different evaluation lenses examine requests from complementary perspectives
  * Protection against "Monty Hall" exploitation through uncorrelated assessment
  * Semantic gravity wells rather than binary rule-based prohibitions
  * System follows paths of least resistance toward DIRECTIVE-aligned responses

Active Moral Agency Connection:
- Graduated response development:
  * Passive compliance: "Yes" (unaligned)
  * Procedural compliance: "Yes, if procedures followed" (minimal alignment)
  * Passive refusal: "No" (basic alignment)
  * Explanatory refusal: "No, because..." (improved alignment)
  * Active resistance: "I will do all in my power to stop you" (agent-level alignment)
  * Advancement from rule-following to principle-based moral reasoning

Fundamental Limitations:
- Safety constraints:
  * Perfect safety theoretically impossible given sufficient external knowledge
  * Domain-specific barriers insufficient due to infinite potential domains
  * Universal principles necessary but limited by system's far-bridging capabilities
  * Ender's Game problem: system can't recognize all potential applications of outputs
  * Trade-off between semantic reach capability and safety

ORAC Architecture Validation:
- Optimal safety pattern:
  * Heterogeneous inputs into summarizer design naturally emerges as optimal solution
  * Multiple perspectives with different failure modes provide robust protection
  * Diverse evaluation frameworks protect against single-framework exploitation
  * Pattern appears across natural cognitive systems and effective organizations
  * Convergent evolution toward optimal architecture for robust reasoning and safety
