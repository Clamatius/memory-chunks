content: """
Core Framework (March 2025):
- Literary prediction as structured cognition:
  * Hypothesis formation based on limited information
  * Progressive refinement through new data integration
  * Parallel to scientific method in narrative context
  * Temperature modulation throughout analysis process
  * Practical demonstration of semantic bridge-building

Implementation Strategy:
- Training methodology:
  * Page-by-page progressive disclosure technique
  * Explicit prediction commitment before new information
  * Probability assignment to multiple possible outcomes
  * Bridge identification linking disparate textual elements
  * Error analysis for prediction misalignment

Key Cognitive Mechanisms:
- Skills development patterns:
  * Pattern recognition across narrative elements
  * Temperature adjustment based on information density
  * Hyperdimensional navigation identifying potential trajectories
  * Foreshadowing identification (Chekhov's gun principle)
  * Model refinement through iterative feedback

Educational Applications:
- Instructional design:
  * Fiction as controlled environment for hypothesis testing
  * Literary structure as cognitive framework
  * Genre conventions as navigation heuristics
  * Character development as social modeling
  * Narrative progression as causal reasoning training

Framework Validation:
- Success indicators:
  * Improved prediction accuracy with practice
  * Enhanced sensitivity to narrative patterns
  * Decreased surprise at major plot developments
  * Increased appreciation of structural elements
  * Transfer to other predictive domains
