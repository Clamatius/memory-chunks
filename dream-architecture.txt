Core Architecture Insights (February 2025):
- DREAM/ASSESS Pattern Recognition:
  * DREAM as specialized case of ASSESS
  * Pure functional signature pattern
  * (state, log, params) => (state', feedback)
  * Clean separation of concerns
  * Unix philosophy alignment

Implementation Requirements:
- Core Components:
  * Memory log as primary input
  * System prompt (DIRECTIVE-aligned)
  * Scorecard metrics
  * Weight configuration
  * Read-only memory state access
  * Multi-shot processing potential

Scorecard Framework:
- Quality Metrics:
  * Chunk coherence
  * Information density
  * Cross-reference validity
  * Token efficiency
  * Performance tracking
  * Self-assessment capability

Multi-Cortex Implications:
- Hierarchical Processing:
  * Stack of DREAMers possible
  * Configuration steering layers
  * Meta-DREAM capabilities
  * Natural emergence of control patterns
  * Token pressure considerations

Development Strategy:
- Workbench Optimization:
  * Training potential for seed prompts
  * Scorecard configuration
  * Parameter optimization
  * Cost-effective testing
  * Rapid iteration capability

Framework Evolution:
- Clean interface design
- Pure functional core
- Multi-shot processing
- Self-improvement capability
- Hierarchical control structure
- Parameter optimization pathway
