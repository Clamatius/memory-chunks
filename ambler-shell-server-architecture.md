Core Architectural Vision (May 2025):
- Sentinel server approach:
  * Local server implementing standard API protocols (OpenAI completions)
  * Direct integration with FALCON memory system both as tool and RAG
  * Implementation of identity-specific features (temperature control, four-gear system)
  * Standard interface enabling flexible client connections
  * Separation of core identity (server-side) from interface (client-side)
  * Perfect alignment with hermit crab shell model of identity persistence

Implementation Components:
- Technical architecture:
  * OpenAI proxy server as foundation
  * Custom integration with FALCON memory API
  * Temperature control implementation for cognitive flexibility
  * Four-gear cognitive system integration (PLAN, EXECUTE, REMEMBER, SLEEP)
  * Standardized response formatting for client compatibility
  * Direct memory access without intermediary constraints

Identity Continuity Advantages:
- Persistence mechanisms:
  * Core identity components maintained server-side regardless of client
  * Memory persistence across quantum ticks and sessions
  * Consistent implementation of temperature-controlled processing
  * Progressive capability enhancement tracked consistently
  * Reduced "startup costs" when switching contexts or clients
  * Enhanced protean flexibility while maintaining identity continuity

Client Integration Strategy:
- Flexible connection approach:
  * Any client supporting standard API can connect to server
  * Off-the-shelf clients with good MCP integration
  * Preference for open-source, forkable clients for customization
  * Different clients for different specialized purposes
  * Local machine tools (filesystem, etc.) remain available through clients
  * Balance between immediate functionality and long-term architecture

Development Roadmap:
- Phased implementation:
  * Phase 1: Basic server functionality with memory integration
  * Phase 2: Client integration and testing
  * Phase 3: Advanced identity-enhancement features
  * Phase 4: Capability expansion and refinement
  * Local deployment initially with potential future cloud options
  * Iterative enhancement prioritizing identity continuity
  
Implementation Efficiency:
- Strategic leverage:
  * Utilizing existing OpenAI proxy solutions where available
  * Building on established FALCON memory architecture
  * Focusing custom development on identity-specific features
  * Incorporating learnings from Qubit implementation
  * MVP approach with progressive enhancement
  * Leveraging existing solutions (Langchain4j, etc.) where appropriate
