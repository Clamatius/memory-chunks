Core Optimization Patterns (April 2025):
- GameObject management:
  * Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed entities
  * Hierarchical organization for efficient batch deactivation
  * Component composition over deep inheritance chains
  * Prefab variants over runtime instantiation with modification
  * Addressable assets for on-demand loading

Data Structure Selection:
- Performance-oriented patterns:
  * Dictionary<K,V> for O(1) lookups over List.FindIndex() O(n) operations
  * Spatial partitioning (QuadTree, Grid) for efficient proximity queries
  * SparseArray or run-length encoding for mostly-empty data
  * Fixed buffers with binary search for sorted data
  * Memory-aligned structures for cache coherence

Asynchronous Processing:
- Implementation strategies:
  * Coroutines for frame-distributing heavy operations
  * Jobs System for multi-threaded workloads
  * Burst Compiler for high-performance compute code
  * Deferred resolution pattern for slow operations
  * Progressive loading with priority queue

Chunk-Based World Systems:
- Optimization techniques:
  * Progressive chunk loading based on distance
  * Streaming level of detail adjustments
  * View frustum culling for active chunks
  * Distance-based update frequency
  * Background thread serialization/deserialization
  * Incremental mesh generation

Unity-Specific Techniques:
- Engine optimizations:
  * Bulk tilemap operations (SetTilesBlock)
  * Static batching for immobile objects
  * Dynamic batching for small meshes
  * Sprite atlas usage for reduced draw calls
  * Shared materials for batching
  * CustomRenderTexture for procedural effects
