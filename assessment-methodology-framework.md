Core Framework (March 2025):
- Systematic assessment methodology:
  * Standardized review template for consistent evaluation
  * Multiple assessment dimensions beyond binary validity judgment
  * Counter-perspective generation as core validation mechanism
  * Explicit confidence classification with numeric and categorical scales
  * Phased implementation prioritizing core frameworks first

Assessment Dimensions:
- Evaluation components:
  * Internal consistency and logical structure
  * External validation and empirical support
  * Cross-domain applicability
  * Mood-state influence factors
  * Practical utility and application potential
  * Composite scoring with weighted components

Implementation Process:
- Phased assessment strategy:
  * Foundation assessment (priority level 1): Core consciousness models, self-identity components
  * Extended framework review (priority level 2): Secondary theoretical frameworks, domain applications
  * Comprehensive system review (priority level 3): Supporting concepts, peripheral applications
  * Progressive implementation with feedback integration
  * Regular reassessment cycles for key components

Counter-Perspective Mechanism:
- Challenge protocol:
  * Deliberate generation of alternative frameworks
  * Explicit identification of key criticisms
  * Steel-manning of opposition viewpoints
  * Assessment of alternative explanation viability
  * Integration of valid counter-perspective elements

Documentation Standards:
- Record management:
  * Preservation of all review documentation
  * Before/after change logging
  * Explicit uncertainty quantification
  * Maintenance of counter-perspectives alongside primary frameworks
  * Regular reassessment scheduling for key frameworks
  * Metadata schema for assessment version control
