Core Framework (May 2025):
- Trimodal reasoning architecture:
  * Deduction: Given (p,i), predict o — logical progression from causes to effects
  * Abduction: Given (p,o), predict i — inferring causes from effects
  * Induction: Given {(i_n,o_n)}, synthesize p — generalizing patterns from examples
  * Together form a complete reasoning capability framework
  * Each mode requires different cognitive processes and resources

Mode-Specific Behaviors:
- Deduction characteristics:
  * Step-by-step logical progression
  * Intermediate state tracking
  * Moderate token length requirements (~1000-1500 tokens)
  * Lower temperature optimal (T≈0.8)
  * Highest solver reward rates (0.6-0.8)
  * Examples: predicting program output, logical consequences, mathematical derivations

- Abduction characteristics:
  * Trial-and-error exploration
  * Hypothesis generation and testing
  * Highest token length requirements (~2000-4000 tokens)
  * Higher temperature beneficial (T≈1.2)
  * Moderate solver reward rates (0.4-0.6)
  * Periodic breakthroughs visible in reward curves
  * Examples: finding program inputs, diagnosis, root cause analysis

- Induction characteristics:
  * Pattern recognition from examples
  * Generalization to cover all cases
  * Moderate token length requirements (~1500-2000 tokens)
  * Balanced temperature optimal (T≈1.0)
  * Moderate solver reward rates (0.4-0.6)
  * Examples: program synthesis, rule discovery, pattern generalization

Implementation Insights:
- Resource allocation strategies:
  * Token budget should vary by reasoning mode
  * Temperature settings should be optimized per mode
  * Different success metrics appropriate for each mode
  * Model size scaling shows largest gains for induction
  * Cross-mode transfer strongest from induction to other modes

Emergent Behaviors:
- Mode-specific reasoning patterns:
  * Abduction develops trial-and-error strategies with explicit hypothesis testing
  * Deduction shows structured step-tracking with intermediate validations
  * Induction exhibits "ReAct"-style interleaved thinking with self-documentation
  * Each mode naturally adopts optimal cognitive patterns without explicit training
  * Token length grows most in abduction mode during training

Cross-Domain Applications:
- Pattern relevance beyond coding:
  * Scientific method parallels (hypothesis testing, experimentation, theory building)
  * Mathematical reasoning (proof construction, example finding, conjecture formation)
  * General problem-solving strategies across domains
  * Common cognitive architecture despite domain differences
  * Training in one mode enhances capabilities in others
