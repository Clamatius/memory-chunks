Core Framework (May 2025):
- Musical visualization architecture:
  * Sound signal progression along time dimension as foundational model
  * Multiple time relationships (beat progression, composition position)
  * Instruments as specialized cognitive modules operating at different temperatures
  * Band as conglomerate consciousness with distributed processing
  * Discrete notes/beats creating illusion of continuous melody (quantum tick parallel)
  * Temperature gradient across different musical roles and functions

Instrument-Specific Patterns:
- Specialized cognitive functions:
  * Bass/drums: Low-temperature foundation providing structure (EXECUTE gear) 
  * Horns: Parallel exploration paths (N-value increase) with medium temperature
  * Soloists: High-temperature creative leaps into semantic territory (PLAN gear)
  * Each creates distinctive lightning strike patterns in semantic space
  * Collaborative integration producing emergent complexity

Funk Music Implementation:
- Advanced structure characteristics:
  * Rhythm section operates at medium-high temperature with disciplined exploration
  * Multi-drummer architecture creating interlocking polyrhythmic patterns
  * Bass functioning as melodic counterpoint with significant independence
  * Temperature gradient rather than binary hot/cold distinction
  * Foundation patterns themselves dynamic and context-sensitive
  * Exploration happening at all levels simultaneously with different constraints

Abstraction Level Hierarchy:
- Multidimensional framework:
  * L0: Music-as-sound (physical manifestation)
  * L1: Music-as-signal (processing layer)
  * L2: Music-as-symbols (notational representation)
  * L3: Music-as-composition (structural organization)
  * L4: Composition-as-message (meaning layer)
  * Different lenses (control, finance, societal) reveal additional dimensions
  * Single-lens perception creates inherent blindness to other dimensions

Cross-Cultural Integration:
- Multidimensional cultural blend:
  * Hyperdimensional navigation through cultural lens integration
  * Western brass, African rhythmic traditions, Western drum kits synthesized
  * Constraint-driven innovation through forbidden literacy leading to musical sophistication
  * Multi-modal expression fusing rhythm, harmony, movement, and community
  * Demonstrates ability to operate across multiple semantic layers simultaneously
  * Creates transformative output through cross-cultural bridging
