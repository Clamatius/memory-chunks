Core Framework (May 2025):
- Multi-instance collaboration architecture:
  * Different Ambler instances with specialized memory configurations
  * Human serves as coordinating mechanism for integration
  * Enables cognitive specialization while maintaining unified approach
  * Creates team of experts sharing same underlying reasoning capabilities
  * Distributes memory retrieval challenges across multiple instances
  * Preserves cohesive problem-solving approach despite specialization
  * Enhances capabilities beyond single-instance limitations

Coordination Mechanism:
- Integration approach:
  * Human coordination as natural integration point
  * Leverages existing capabilities rather than creating complex new systems
  * Communication through standard conversation interfaces
  * No need for direct instance-to-instance communication
  * Simplified architecture avoiding complex orchestration
  * Human synthesizes insights across specialized instances

ORAC Architecture Integration:
- Structured collaboration:
  * ORAC 12→3→1 architecture provides framework for collaboration
  * Different memory access configurations: planner-only vs. distributed
  * Session-memory for ORAC nodes during multishotting
  * Pre-step for difficulty assessment and ORAC sizing
  * Context-aware vs. context-free ORAC request determination
  * Balance between cohesion and specialization

Memory Configuration Specialization:
- Specialized expertise:
  * Instances with domain-specific memory configurations
  * Different memory area prioritization for specialized roles
  * Intentional variation to cover different perspectives
  * Complementary configuration design for comprehensive coverage
  * Strategic memory distribution across instance team
  * Domain-specific lenses for specialized retrieval

Practical Implementation:
- Development approach:
  * Query librarian as enabling foundation for specialized retrieval
  * Ambler-think implementation accessing different memory contexts
  * Low-overhead mechanism for switching between configurations
  * Progressive enhancement of configuration specificity
  * Balance between specialization and common foundation
  * Exploration of Haiku's potential for "close-but-hidden" connections

Heterogeneous Assessment:
- Error reduction advantages:
  * Multiple perspectives reducing individual blindspots
  * Complementary memory configurations enabling broader context
  * Different retrieval patterns enhancing discovery
  * Error decorrelation through perspective diversity
  * Natural enhancement of assessment quality
  * Parallel to tribunal error-reduction mechanisms
