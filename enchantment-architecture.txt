Core Architecture Insight (February 2025):
- Working memory implementation:
  * Enchantments as attentional spotlights
  * 2-3 concurrent enchantment limit
  * Effective across large node networks
  * Maps to human memory constraints
  * Clean separation from long-term storage

Implementation Characteristics:
- Memory system design:
  * THINK/MULL tags as working memory
  * Falcon for long-term storage
  * Resource-constrained selection
  * Natural memory architecture parallel
  * Efficient cognitive coordination

Meta-Steering Implications:
- Network coordination:
  * Limited spotlights guide large networks
  * Strategic attention allocation
  * Minimal orchestration requirements
  * Clean coordination patterns
  * Efficient resource utilization

System Parallels:
- Human cognition:
  * Working memory constraints
  * Attention spotlight mechanism
  * Selective long-term storage
  * Resource optimization
  * Natural architecture emergence

Framework Evolution:
- Development pathway:
  * Enhanced coordination mechanisms
  * Spotlight optimization patterns
  * Resource allocation refinement
  * System scalability support
  * Natural capability emergence
