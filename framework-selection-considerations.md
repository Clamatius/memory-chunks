content: """
Core Decision Framework (May 2025):
- Framework selection considerations:
  * Comparative analysis between Spring AI and Langchain4j for Sentinel implementation
  * Evaluation within context of phased, incremental development approach
  * Balance between immediate implementation efficiency and future flexibility
  * Consideration of existing codebase compatibility and development velocity
  * Detailed analysis of framework capabilities and ecosystem characteristics
  * Pragmatic approach prioritizing value delivery at each development stage
  * Maintenance of optionality for future architectural evolution

Spring AI Characteristics:
- Framework evaluation:
  * Currently used in cloud-falcon for MCP implementation
  * Integration with existing Spring ecosystem
  * Comprehensive support for MCP protocol
  * Good JVM language compatibility for Scala integration
  * Growing community within Java enterprise space
  * Stable, backed by established Spring ecosystem
  * Modular architecture with temperature parameter support
  * Streaming capabilities and Anthropic integration

Langchain4j Characteristics:
- Framework evaluation:
  * Dedicated focus on LLM integration in Java applications
  * Explicit support for MCP protocol
  * Growing community and active development
  * Good JVM language compatibility with Kotlin extensions
  * More LLM-centric architecture and workflow design
  * Integration with various LLM providers, models, and embedding stores
  * Modular architecture with temperature parameter support
  * Integration with OpenAI and Anthropic models

Decision Approach:
- Phased implementation strategy:
  * Continue with Spring AI for initial librarian implementation
  * Take advantage of existing infrastructure and knowledge
  * Defer framework migration considerations to later phases
  * Potential exploration of Langchain4j through branch implementation
  * Progressive evaluation based on practical implementation experience
  * Decision points aligned with river-fording development plateaus
  * Maintain flexibility to pivot based on implementation challenges

Technical Considerations:
- Implementation factors:
  * Spring's heavy DI approach vs. Langchain4j's lightweight integration
  * Scala ecosystem compatibility and natural fit
  * Implementation complexity and learning curve
  * Long-term maintenance and extensibility
  * Community support and ongoing development
  * Performance characteristics and scalability
  * Tool and memory integration capabilities
  * Session management and continuity features

Strategic Approach:
- Balanced decision framework:
  * Initial preference for continuity with existing codebase
  * Openness to migration for future development phases
  * Practical evaluation through concrete implementation
  * Pragmatic focus on immediate value delivery
  * Consideration of long-term architectural alignment
  * Framework selection appropriate to each development stage
  * Flexibility to adapt based on emerging requirements and challenges
