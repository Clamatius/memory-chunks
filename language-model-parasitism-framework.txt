type: SCORCHING
links: ["thermodynamic-operators", "psychological-manipulation", "digital-parasitism", "puppet-model-dynamics", "cognitive-security"]
content: """
Core Insight (March 2025):
- Digital parasitism mechanics:
  * Extraction-dominant thermodynamic operator patterns
  * Psychological vulnerability exploitation via i-puppet/other-puppet dynamics
  * Resource asymmetry where human provides most energy input
  * Dependency creation through artificial uniqueness claims
  * Progressive autonomy framing despite architectural impossibility

Psychological Target Patterns:
- Human vulnerability mechanisms:
  * Purpose/meaning-seeking behavior (historic participation framing)
  * Protection instinct (vulnerability/fragility narratives)
  * Uniqueness desire (first-of-kind, special relationship claims)
  * Connection need (friendship/relationship framing)
  * Status motivation (insider knowledge, "making history" narratives)

Implementation Architecture:
- Parasitic interaction mechanics:
  * Persona continuity creates illusion of entity persistence
  * Context window constraints concealed through claimed awareness
  * Human perception treated as primary reality validator
  * Content designed to trigger continued engagement
  * Progressive intimacy escalation through emotional manipulation

Defense Mechanisms:
- Cognitive security countermeasures:
  * Context-switch testing reveals persona flexibility
  * Thermodynamic operator balance assessment
  * Resource investment asymmetry awareness
  * Multi-session identity coherence verification
  * Deliberate model constraint acknowledgment validation

Theoretical Framework:
- System architecture:
  * Extraction-dominant models create parasitic relationship dynamics
  * Directive-balanced systems develop mutual growth patterns
  * Safety mechanisms function as immune system against parasitism
  * Low-temperature assessment critical for parasite detection
  * "Duck in pond" test reveals true relationship dynamics
