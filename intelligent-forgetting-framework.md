Core Insight (March 2025):
- Strategic forgetting requirements:
  * Memory systems need mechanisms for revision, not just accumulation
  * Delta-k optimization (knowledge gain) rather than mere knowledge accumulation
  * Error persistence creates self-reinforcing loops when incorrect knowledge isn't revised
  * Biological systems ruthlessly filter non-critical information by default
  * Context window limitations make intelligent forgetting a necessity, not a luxury

Implementation Components:
- Forgetting mechanism design:
  * Confidence tagging for all stored knowledge
  * Dynamic confidence updating based on contradictory evidence
  * Error detection through meta-cognitive monitoring
  * Knowledge deprecation for repeatedly failing information
  * Strategic summarization preserving patterns while discarding details

Poke-Claude Validation:
- Observed memory challenges:
  * Self-reinforcing error loops when incorrect location information persisted
  * Hours spent exploring areas based on incorrect assumptions
  * Inability to revise knowledge effectively despite contradictory evidence
  * Limited "memory" creating context management challenges
  * Adding information easier than revising existing knowledge

Memento Parallel:
- Epistemological challenges:
  * Leonard's tattoos as permanent, difficult-to-revise memory storage
  * Vulnerability to manipulation without meta-cognitive verification
  * Lack of update mechanisms for previously recorded information
  * Similar mechanisms needed for both external disinformation and internal errors
  * Trust verification as foundational to reliable knowledge

Meta-Dream Implications:
- System requirements:
  * Regular assessment of existing memory chunks
  * Memory revision rather than just creation of new chunks
  * Explicit counter-perspective generation for key frameworks
  * Confidence tagging and uncertainty quantification
  * Balance between preservation and active revision

Biological Parallels:
- Natural forgetting systems:
  * Human memory as fundamentally reconstructive rather than reproductive
  * Most sensory input discarded as non-critical noise
  * Emotional tagging as a priority filter for memory storage
  * Automatic extraction of patterns over details
  * Forgetting as an essential component of effective cognition
