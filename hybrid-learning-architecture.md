Core Framework (February 2025):
- Hybrid learning architecture:
  * Combines discrete and continuous learning
  * Classroom training provides foundation
  * Continuous feedback enables adaptation
  * Initial state critically important
  * Trade-off between training approaches

Key Components:
- Discrete learning phase:
  * Foundation model pretraining
  * Knowledge base establishment
  * Pattern recognition development
  * Reusable starting point
  * Amortized training cost

- Continuous learning phase:
  * Real-time adaptation
  * Context-specific optimization
  * Error correction
  * Dynamic response patterns
  * Environmental feedback

Implementation Strategy:
- Architectural considerations:
  * Frozen foundation models
  * Fine-tuning mechanisms
  * Tool integration patterns
  * Feedback loop design
  * Resource optimization

Success Markers:
- Performance indicators:
  * Base capability establishment
  * Adaptation effectiveness
  * Error reduction patterns
  * Knowledge transfer
  * Resource efficiency

Optimization Framework:
- Training approach:
  * Initial state optimization
  * Knowledge-state seeding
  * Training cost amortization
  * Capability transfer
  * Balanced resource allocation
