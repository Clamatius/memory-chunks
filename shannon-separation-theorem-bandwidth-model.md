Core Framework (April 2025):
- Shannon's Separation Theorem fundamentals:
  * Optimal communication achieved by separately optimizing source coding (compression) and channel coding (error correction)
  * Theoretical validity limited to specific conditions: point-to-point communication, stationary sources, unlimited complexity, infinite block lengths
  * Rarely applicable in practical systems with computational constraints
  * Provides theoretical upper bound but not practically achievable in most real-world scenarios
  * Joint source-channel coding often more efficient for practical applications

Practical Limitations:
- Real-world constraints challenging separation:
  * Computational complexity and processing power limitations
  * Delay sensitivity and finite block length requirements
  * Non-stationary channels with time-varying characteristics
  * Multi-user scenarios beyond point-to-point communication
  * Energy and power constraints in wireless systems
  * Hardware implementation constraints on embedded devices

Bandwidth-Computation Tradeoff Framework:
- Total Energy Cost = B(m) + C(m) for any message format m
  * B(m) represents bandwidth-related energy costs
  * C(m) represents computation-related energy costs
  * Different messaging protocols optimize different points on this tradeoff curve
  * Minimizing this equation provides optimal message format design
  * No single "ideal" format exists across all systems and contexts

Practical Framework Applications:
- System-specific optimizations:
  * Bandwidth-constrained environments prioritize computational efficiency
  * Computation-constrained environments prioritize bandwidth efficiency
  * Signal processing distribution between sender and receiver based on relative constraints
  * Adaptive protocols that shift B/C balance based on context
  * Energy-efficiency optimization across entire communication stack
