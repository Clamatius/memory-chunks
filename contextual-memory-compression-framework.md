content: """
Core Framework (April 2025):
- Memory compression mechanics:
  * Succinct summarization of memory chunks for extended graph traversal
  * Preservation of essential semantic content while reducing token usage
  * Extension of search-with-neighbors to include compressed representations
  * Graph expansion beyond primary result limits through summarization
  * Balance between comprehensive exploration and context preservation

Implementation Strategy:
- Technical approach:
  * Two-tier result structure with full content and summaries
  * Predefined summary count beyond primary result limits
  * On-demand summarization during search operations
  * Cached summaries for frequently accessed chunks
  * Toggle mechanisms for compression activation

Search Enhancement Benefits:
- Capability improvements:
  * Broader semantic landscape visibility during search
  * Extended graph traversal without context window exhaustion
  * More comprehensive understanding of domain relationships
  * Balance between depth and breadth in semantic exploration
  * Efficient knowledge transfer with optimized token usage

Summarization Methodology:
- Compression techniques:
  * Domain-specific summarization strategies
  * Key point extraction based on content type
  * Preservation of defining characteristics
  * Hierarchical summarization for nested concepts
  * Temperature-appropriate detail preservation

Integration Path:
- Development roadmap:
  * Extension of search-with-neighbors as initial implementation
  * Parameter additions for summary count control
  * Summary quality metrics for effectiveness assessment
  * Progressive enhancement through feedback incorporation
  * Balance with query librarian for result organization
