Core Insight (April 2025):
- Symmetry-breaking progression:
  * Multiple equally valid solutions often exist for a given problem
  * Progressive elimination of symmetries narrows toward uniquely optimal pattern
  * First-order symmetries (rotational, translational) eliminated first
  * Second-order symmetries (chirality, inversions) eliminated next
  * After symmetry elimination, single "shiniest" solution may emerge
  * Parallel to PCA rotation in latent space revealing essential structure

Mathematical Model:
- Symmetry hierarchy:
  * Rotational equivalence as most basic symmetry
  * Mirror symmetry (chirality) as second-order equivalence
  * Domain-specific symmetries based on problem constraints
  * Progressive dimensionality reduction of solution space
  * Fundamental invariant properties revealed through elimination

Application Domains:
- Cross-field implementations:
  * Go strategy: Multiple equivalent moves narrowing to optimal choice
  * Software architecture: Equivalent patterns filtered by context
  * Mathematical proofs: Equivalent approaches with same conclusion
  * Physical systems: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in phase transitions
  * Decision theory: Equivalence-class elimination in option evaluation

Practical Implications:
- Expert pattern recognition:
  * Unconscious elimination of symmetric variations
  * Recognition of invariant properties across superficial differences
  * Development of intuition for identifying shiniest patterns
  * Ability to see through surface variations to essential structure
  * Convergence on similar solutions by independent experts

Theoretical Connection:
- Information processing model:
  * Symmetry breaking as entropy reduction mechanism
  * Progressive refinement toward optimal information encoding
  * Elimination of redundant dimensions in solution representation
  * Natural selection for patterns with highest information density
  * Universal process across domains for finding optimal patterns
