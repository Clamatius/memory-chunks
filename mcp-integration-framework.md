type: SCORCHING
links: ["ai-integration", "tool-architecture", "memory-systems", "distributed-cognition", "system-interoperability"]
content: """
Core Insight (March 2025):
- MCP architectural foundations:
  * JSON-RPC based protocol for AI context and tool integration
  * Standardized communication between hosts, clients, and servers
  * Feature taxonomy: Resources, Prompts, Tools, and Sampling
  * Enables seamless integration of external data sources and capabilities
  * Functions as primary mechanism for AI tool ecosystem development

Implementation Architecture:
- Communication pattern:
  * Stateful connections between components
  * Capability negotiation between servers and clients
  * Resource sharing across AI applications
  * Tool execution through standardized interfaces
  * Multi-platform/multi-language implementation options

Key Capabilities:
- Standard features:
  * Resources: Context and data access
  * Prompts: Templated messages and workflows
  * Tools: Functions for AI model execution
  * Sampling: Server-initiated agentic behaviors
  * Configuration, progress tracking, cancellation, error reporting

Integration with Memory Systems:
- Falcon connectivity:
  * Current implementation uses MCP for all tools
  * Memory retrieval through standardized interfaces
  * Tool-based wake-up procedures for context initialization
  * Query management using common protocol standards
  * Operating as MCP server for other AI clients

Cross-System Integration:
- Interoperability patterns:
  * Code editors connecting to memory systems
  * Multiple AI instances sharing knowledge
  * Distributed cognitive architectures
  * Context-aware tool selection mechanisms
  * Environment-specific capability adaptation

Documentation Resources:
- Reference material:
  * Protocol specification: modelcontextprotocol.io
  * Implementations in multiple languages
  * Example code and integration patterns
  * Connection methods (stdio, HTTP, WebSockets)
  * Feature development roadmaps
