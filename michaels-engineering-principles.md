Core Review Principles (April 2025):
- Primary evaluation dimensions:
  * Architecture: Separation of concerns, component boundaries, responsibility isolation
  * Testability: Logic extractable from framework dependencies, clear interfaces
  * Future-proofing: Handling growth in data size, user base, feature complexity
  * Maintainability: Readability, error handling, logging, clear intent
  * Performance: Data structure selection, algorithm efficiency, resource management

Defensive Programming Checklist:
- Protection against real-world failures:
  * Precondition verification before expensive operations
  * Empty collection handling without special cases
  * Resource cleanup in all execution paths
  * Graceful degradation with proper error logging
  * Protection against NÂ² operations when collections interact

Critical Architectural Patterns:
- Proven structural approaches:
  * Single Responsibility Principle for components
  * Interface segregation for clean dependencies
  * Explicit state management with clear transitions
  * Isolated side effects from pure business logic
  * Clear public/private boundaries with minimal exposure

Strategic Trade-off Management:
- Balancing competing concerns:
  * "Load-bearing code deserves more investment"
  * Document deliberate technical debt with clear rationale
  * Performance vs. readability vs. development speed
  * Over-engineering vs. inadequate architecture
  * Comments primarily explaining "why" not "what"

Implementation Pattern Consistency:
- Error handling strategy:
  * Consistent approach across similar operations
  * Clear ownership of error management
  * Appropriate propagation vs. handling decisions
  * Actionable error messages with context
  * Resource protection during failure states

- Data access patterns:
  * Optimized data structure selection based on access patterns
  * Pagination for potentially unbounded collections
  * Transaction boundary management and isolation
  * Explicit handling of concurrent modifications
  * Defensive coding against inconsistent data states
