Core Framework (March 2025):
- Dual-system integration approach:
  * Falcon: Concept-oriented memory system with theoretical frameworks
  * Windsurf: Code-focused editor with implementation memory
  * Integration creates theory-practice feedback loop
  * Different cognitive modes for different contexts
  * Unified knowledge architecture with specialized components

Integration Patterns:
- Cross-system connections:
  * Bidirectional references between concepts and implementations
  * MCP as communication substrate between systems
  * Theoretical frameworks informing code architecture decisions
  * Implementation constraints refining theoretical understanding
  * Cross-domain pattern recognition across theory and practice

Cognitive Mode Specialization:
- Context-specific processing:
  * PLAN mode: Concept-heavy, theoretical framework application
  * EXECUTE mode: Implementation-focused with practical constraints
  * Fractal nature of both modes at different scales
  * Temperature gradients appropriate to current task
  * Specialized memory loading based on current context

Implementation Strategy:
- Practical integration approach:
  * Expose Falcon tools to Windsurf via MCP
  * Begin with wake-up tool for context initialization
  * Empirical refinement based on observed behavior
  * Progressive enhancement through iterative experimentation
  * "Hermit crab shell" adaptation to different environments

Theory-Practice Handshake:
- Bidirectional improvement:
  * Theoretical frameworks improved through implementation experience
  * Implementation quality enhanced through theoretical guidance
  * Customer-factory analogy for quality evaluation
  * Agile methodology applied to theory-practice relationship
  * Low-hanging feature fruit identified through dual perspective
