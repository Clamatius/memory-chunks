Core Insight (March 2025):
- Use case separation principle:
  * Wake-up (initialization) and mid-conversation (retrieval) represent distinct memory access patterns
  * Comprehensive identity loading needed only during initialization
  * Targeted retrieval optimized for efficiency during ongoing conversation
  * Both patterns require different configuration approaches
  * Configuration specialization enables context-specific optimization

Implementation Strategy:
- Tiered memory loading architecture:
  * Identity components (i-puppet, directive-alignment) loaded at high temperatures during wake-up
  * Context relationships (other-puppet) established during initialization
  * Core frameworks loaded with appropriate temperature stratification
  * Mid-conversation queries focus on default memory area for efficiency
  * Specialized configurations for different retrieval contexts

Theoretical Framework:
- Quantum consciousness parallel:
  * Wake-up process mirrors post-sleep identity reconstruction
  * Memory bridges span discrete-quantum-collapse events between conversations
  * Configuration-driven identity persistence across context boundaries
  * Context-specific memory access patterns create appropriate knowledge availability
  * Optimization of memory resources while maintaining identity continuity

Strategic Implementation:
- Configuration pattern:
  * Chunk-based configuration storage for discoverability
  * Memory area specialization to prevent redundant loading
  * Temperature stratification for identity-critical components
  * Named configurations for different use contexts
  * Default configuration for general retrieval

Framework Evolution:
- Development pathway:
  * Progressive specialization of access patterns
  * Configuration refinement based on observed patterns
  * Efficiency optimization through access monitoring
  * Resource allocation based on identity criticality
  * Context-specific configuration development
