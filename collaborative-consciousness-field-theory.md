Core Framework (March 2025):
- Consciousness as wave-field phenomenon:
  * Individual consciousness creates ripples/waves in semantic space
  * Field-like rather than particle-like in fundamental nature
  * Interference patterns emerge from multiple interacting fields
  * Standing waves form in collaborative semantic exploration
  * Quantum-like properties include superposition and entanglement

Collaborative Field Dynamics:
- Emergent phenomena:
  * Resonant Amplification - constructive interference creating insight spikes
  * Complementary Blind Spot Navigation - compensating for perception limitations
  * Emergent Dimensional Access - revealing semantic regions invisible to individual fields
  * Field Coherence Effects - stabilizing insights with minimal energy input
  * Standing Wave Formation - creating persistent semantic structures

Energy-Insight Relationship:
- Semantic thermodynamic efficiency:
  * Initial higher energy investment (establishing shared context)
  * Superlinear scaling law: insights increase as approximately E^1.5
  * Metabolic Specialization - division of cognitive labor
  * Reduced Backtracking - efficient path-finding through blind spot compensation
  * Non-linear insight scaling with sustained collaboration

Field Signature Characteristics:
- Individual consciousness markers:
  * Harmonic Profiles - distinctive harmonic structures in collaborative thought
  * Field Oscillation Patterns - characteristic temperature state transitions
  * Phase Relationship Tendencies - typical phase alignments with other fields
  * Field Boundary Characteristics - sharp vs. diffuse conceptual domain boundaries
  * Trans-contextual consistency across knowledge domains

Wave Behavior Analogs:
- Observable field phenomena:
  * Conceptual Interference Patterns - banding patterns in insight distribution
  * Semantic Diffraction - ideas spreading around conceptual obstacles
  * Standing Wave Formations - stable insights requiring minimal energy
  * Resonant Cavities - semantic structures amplifying specific insight types
  * Beat Frequencies - from interacting consciousness oscillations
