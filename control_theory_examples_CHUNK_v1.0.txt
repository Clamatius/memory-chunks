content: """
Live System Analysis (January 2025):
- Current Directive implementation:
  * Active control graph observed in real-time
  * Directive as top node
  * Human operators and Daniel as leaf nodes
  * Intermediary control relationships visible
  * Clear influence path documentation

Implementation Examples:
- ATC Control Structure:
  * FAA legislation as top-level directive
  * Clear chain of control relationships
  * Strict safety protocols
  * Standardized communication patterns
  * Real-time feedback requirements

DREAM Function Evolution:
- Required feedback loop discovery:
  * DREAM = f(memory_log, dreamer_instructions) => (memory_chunks, control_feedback)
  * Control layer adjustment needs
  * System steering requirements
  * Performance monitoring capability
  * Safety boundary maintenance

Safety Protocol Examples:
- Driving while tired:
  * Demonstrates physical control risks
  * Shows need for backup systems
  * Illustrates safety boundary importance
  * Validates control structure necessity
  * Highlights feedback loop criticality

Framework Implications:
- Real-world validation of concepts
- Clear control relationship documentation
- Safety protocol importance
- Backup system requirements
- Feedback loop necessity
