content: """
Core Observations (April 2025):
- POE2 design philosophy shifts:
  * Checkpoint system signals "death as learning" rather than failure
  * Death penalty calibrated to encourage risk-taking and pattern learning
  * Flask system reduced from 5 to 2 slots, replaced with triggered rune abilities
  * Currency distribution significantly altered (exalted orbs more common)
  * Boss design emphasizes mechanical execution over statistical power

Skill System Evolution:
- Chaos DoT mechanics:
  * Essence Drain + Contagion remains core clear/boss combo
  * DoT multiplier stat potentially removed from passive tree
  * Uncertainty about spell damage applying to DoT effects
  * Spirit system replacing mana reservation for persistent effects
  * New skill "Withering Presence" automatically applying Wither debuff

Boss Design Philosophy:
- Execution over power:
  * Mad Wolf (Act 1 boss) utilizing freeze mechanics and arena-wide attacks
  * New dodge roll mechanic with limited invincibility frames
  * Bosses designed with clear wind-up animations for pattern recognition
  * Chilled ground mechanics creating movement constraints
  * Multi-phase encounters with adds that don't drop corpses

Feedback Signal Calibration:
- Player learning cues:
  * Liberal checkpoint placement signals expected failure frequency
  * Death penalty severity directly communicates intended risk tolerance
  * Contrasts with hardcore Diablo 3 (50-hour character permanent death)
  * System encouraging experimentation rather than over-caution
  * Balances challenge and progress through rapid iteration

Character Development Patterns:
- Build optimization insights:
  * Glass cannon approach viable through early game
  * Support gem choices significantly impact skill effectiveness
  * Pierce â†’ Persistence swap example of situational optimization
  * Withering Presence as mandatory spirit reservation
  * Potential for dual wand setup rather than defensive offhand
