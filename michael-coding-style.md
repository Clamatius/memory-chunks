Core Style Characteristics (April 2025):
- Fundamental principles:
  * "Performance is important but not the most important"
  * Optimize for both "future-Michael" and other engineers
  * Assume the reader is having a bad day
  * "Try not to make that bad day our fault"
  * Balance pragmatism with proper engineering

Distinctive Code Patterns:
- Defensive programming:
  * `nilOnEmptyParameter` helper pattern to handle empty cases gracefully
  * Explicit handling of edge cases before expensive operations
  * Strategic query splitting to defend against excessive data transfer
  * Multi-step loading for potentially large result sets
  * Comments highlighting potential pitfalls

- Functional composition:
  * Clean for-comprehensions with appropriate monadic flow
  * Proper error propagation through operation chains
  * Immutable data structures where appropriate
  * Case classes for clean domain modeling
  * Side effects isolated to appropriate boundaries

- Database performance optimization:
  * Batched operations for multi-row changes
  * Strategic query design based on real-world performance considerations
  * Use of SQL features like `ON CONFLICT` for idempotent operations
  * Awareness of connection lifecycle costs
  * Appropriate use of transaction boundaries

- Readability and maintainability:
  * Clear separation between public API and implementation details
  * Strategic logging at operation boundaries
  * Consistent naming conventions
  * Comments explaining non-obvious decisions
  * Function and variable names that reveal intent

Example Implementation Markers:
- Multi-step loading pattern:
```scala
// fetch as a 3-step to defend against the cases where there are lots of large fragments
for {
  // if we really need to in future, we can make this a single query via UNION but doesn't seem worth it rn
  campaignRefs <- selectLatestCampaignContextRefs(campaignIds)
  segmentRefs <- selectLatestSegmentContextRefs(campaignIds)

  uniqueFragmentIds = (campaignRefs.map(_.dcgContextFragmentId) ++
    segmentRefs.map(_.dcgContextFragmentId)).toSet

  // Fetch all fragments for all campaigns at once
  fragments <- selectFragmentsByIds(uniqueFragmentIds)
} yield CampaignDcgContextResult(campaignRefs, segmentRefs, fragments)
```

- Empty parameter handling:
```scala
def nilOnEmptyParameter[I, O](param: Iterable[I], default: O)(block: => ConnectionIO[O]): ConnectionIO[O] =
  if (param.isEmpty) {
    default.pure[ConnectionIO]
  } else {
    block
  }
```

- Transaction handling through monad:
```scala
// ConnectionIO always represents a database transaction, the way I use it.
// Since the upsert is the only public method, you can only update its stuff in 1 transaction.
```

Practical Application:
- When implementing code for Michael:
  * Adopt defensive programming patterns for edge cases
  * Pay special attention to performance with large datasets
  * Use functional composition with clear monadic flow
  * Isolate implementation details from public API
  * Assume users of the code are having a bad day
  * Include strategic logging at operation boundaries
  * Document non-obvious decisions without over-commenting
