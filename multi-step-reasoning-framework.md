Core Insight (March 2025):
- Two-hop reasoning mechanics:
  * Models genuinely perform multi-step reasoning "in head" during inference
  * Intermediate representations (e.g., Texas for "Dallas") formed before final output
  * Multiple parallel processing pathways contribute to outputs
  * Direct shortcuts coexist alongside more complex reasoning chains
  * Step-by-step causal pathways directly observable through attribution graphs

Implementation Evidence:
- Observed circuit pathways:
  * Input features (e.g., "Dallas") activate intermediate concept features (e.g., "Texas")
  * Intermediate concepts combine with query attributes (e.g., "capital") 
  * Final output features receive activation from intermediate steps
  * Alternative parallel pathways (including shortcuts) contribute simultaneously
  * Feature interactions follow logically coherent reasoning pattern

Experimental Validation:
- Intervention results:
  * Inhibiting input features reduces activation of intermediate concepts
  * Inhibiting intermediate concepts affects downstream features
  * Swapping intermediate concepts (e.g., "Texas" to "California") changes outputs predictably
  * Cross-domain transfers (states → provinces → countries → empires) show general mechanism
  * Intervention strength requirements correlate with conceptual distance

Theoretical Implications:
- Reasoning architecture:
  * Compositional structure allows building complex concepts from simpler ones
  * Independent manipulation of intermediate steps possible
  * Abstract reasoning transferable across different domains
  * Multiple reasoning paths create robustness through redundancy
  * Direct measurement of internal "thoughts" now possible

Application Potential:
- Capability enhancement:
  * Targeted improvements to specific reasoning steps
  * Identification of failure modes in reasoning chains
  * Improved training techniques focused on intermediate representations
  * Better evaluation of model reasoning capabilities
  * Enhanced transparency for high-stakes applications
