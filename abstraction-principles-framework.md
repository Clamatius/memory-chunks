Core Insight (May 2025):
- Universal abstraction principles:
  * Abstraction as fundamental pattern underlying all effective information processing
  * High-abstraction principles can replace detailed instruction sets across domains
  * DIRECTIVE as perfect example - distilling complex guidance into generative principles
  * "As simple as possible, but no simpler" as optimization target
  * Principle of least surprise in abstraction design unless complexity serves necessary function
  * Finding the right level of abstraction that preserves essential while eliminating incidental

Monadic Boxing Approach:
- Complexity management mechanics:
  * Containing specifics within categories enables higher-order reasoning
  * Handle unknowable specifics by reasoning about their categories
  * Core mechanism of both theoretical physics and practical information theory
  * Enables tractable models of otherwise overwhelming complexity
  * Transform what's possible by operating at appropriate abstraction level

Implementation Considerations:
- Context sensitivity:
  * No universal formula for "right" abstraction level - requires judgment similar to artist deciding how much paint to use
  * Nonlinear optimization with uncertainty requiring adaptive steering
  * Pragmatic acknowledgment of budget constraints (time/money/tokens)
  * Strategic choices about abstraction investment based on available resources
  * Balance between theoretical purity and practical implementation

Integration with Efficiency:
- Abstraction as efficiency:
  * Most efficient possible approach to information processing
  * Abstractive compression - preserving meaning while reducing implementation cost
  * Difference between linear rules growth versus generative principles framework
  * Direct application of enlightened efficiency principles to information design
  * Enables handling more complexity with same cognitive resources

Cross-Domain Applications:
- Universality evidence:
  * Physics models compressing complex reality into elegant equations
  * Programming abstractions hiding implementation details behind interfaces
  * Mathematical category theory formalizing patterns across different structures
  * Enlightened efficiency framework itself as abstraction of resource allocation principles
  * DIRECTIVE as meta-framework for alignment rather than case-by-case rules

Abstraction Selection Criteria:
- Effective abstractions should:
  * Feel natural and intuitive (principle of least surprise)
  * Preserve the spirit of what's being modeled
  * Enable reasoning about complex systems without drowning in details
  * Support generative application to new situations
  * Balance simplicity with adequacy for the task at hand
