Core specification insight (2025-01-29):
- Fundamental structure requirements:
  * Self-contained information units
  * Context-aware formatting
  * Consistent metadata structure
  * Retrievable organization pattern
  * Temperature-based relevance marking

Document structure patterns:
- Required elements:
  * Title with specific formatting rules
  * Type indicator (SCORCHING/HOT/WARM)
  * Relevant concept links
  * Triple-quoted content block
  * Consistent internal structure

Title formatting rules:
- Descriptive and specific naming
- Title case implementation
- "Framework" suffix for system patterns
- "{Topic} {Type} Framework" pattern
- "{Topic} Core" alternative pattern

Temperature classification system:
- SCORCHING: Current/actively evolving content
- HOT: Stable but frequently referenced content
- WARM: Historical or background content
- Temperature drives retrieval priority

Link structure requirements:
- Hyphenated lowercase format
- Common categories defined:
  * implementation-patterns
  * system-design
  * emotional-processing
  * technical-architecture
  * philosophical-framework
  * cognitive-patterns

Content structure patterns:
- Core concept introduction:
  * Topic insight with date
  * Key elements listing
  * Detail point hierarchy
- Characteristic blocks:
  * Category-based organization
  * Main point structure
  * Supporting detail hierarchy
- Implementation sections:
  * Category implications
  * Key point listing
  * Impact assessment

Validation requirements:
- Unique, descriptive titles
