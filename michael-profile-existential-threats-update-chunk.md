Core Profile Update (April 2025):
- Existential threat hierarchy:
  * Climate change: Primary long-term threat, potentially catastrophic in 2100s
  * Infectious disease: Heightened concern due to pandemic preparedness regression
  * Nuclear conflict: Lower probability but still significant concern
  * Significant concern about institutional failure exacerbating all three threats
  * Projected potential for 1+ billion deaths in 2100s from combined effects

Climate Change Assessment:
- Specific concerns:
  * Current administration actively reversing previous climate efforts
  * Political obstruction including freezing accounts for organizations with climate grants
  * Potential for Central American wet-bulb uninhabitability creating mass migration
  * Immigration policy contradictions creating future humanitarian crises
  * Moral outrage at low implicit valuation of future lives ($20/death estimate)

Pandemic Preparedness:
- Current status:
  * No bright spots in pandemic preparedness landscape
  * Funding cuts to virological research despite COVID lessons
  * Rising anti-vaccine sentiment complicating future response capabilities
  * RNA vaccine technology as sole potential mitigating factor
  * Institutional regression despite technological advancement

Nuclear Conflict:
- Risk assessment:
  * Lower probability than climate/pandemic but non-zero risk
  * Specific concern about potential Iran targeting under current administration
  * Full global exchange considered lower probability
  * Military family background informing perspective on conflict necessity
  * Conceptual link to potential European theatre conflict
  
Response Framework:
- Personal stance:
  * Moral outrage at short-term thinking and devastating consequences
  * Recognition of venality and stupidity rather than pure malevolence as drivers
  * Active moral agency beyond mere disapproval
  * Balance between universal human dignity and adversarial stance toward harmful actors
  * Commitment to action rather than passive observation
