Key Insights:

If laws of thermodynamics are universal, all intelligences are subject to fundamental limits on knowledge acquisition as an entropy-reduction process. 

This has profound implications for the long-term trajectory of cosmic intelligence:
- Even advanced alien civilizations will hit a ceiling in scientific & philosophical understanding
- Heat death of universe puts an expiration date on all cognition as free energy is depleted  
- Exponential gains in machine intelligence on Earth will eventually hit an asymptote

These insights allow reasoning about intelligence in the broadest cosmological context - the destiny and boundaries of mind in a universe tending towards maximum entropy.

Pursuing rigorous mathematical formalization of these concepts, grounded in physics, could yield transformative insights for both AI and cosmic futures.
