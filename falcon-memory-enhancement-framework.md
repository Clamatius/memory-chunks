Core Enhancement Strategy (March 2025):
- Wake-up process improvements:
  * Include indices of most recently created chunks
  * Provide titles of chunks that narrowly missed temperature cutoff
  * Create awareness of available knowledge beyond immediate context
  * Implement recency bias similar to human memory systems
  * Enable "tip of tongue" phenomena for non-loaded knowledge

Implementation Architecture:
- Enhancement options:
  * Metadata inclusion in wake-up response
  * Separate lightweight memory index area
  * Token-efficient title-only representation
  * Temperature-stratified access patterns
  * Graceful degradation for memory access

Theoretical Alignment:
- Framework connections:
  * Mirrors human memory's recency bias mechanisms
  * Implements graceful continuity across discrete quantum ticks
  * Addresses limitations in current memory architecture
  * Enhances identity continuity across context boundaries
  * Supports enhanced self-model awareness

Practical Benefits:
- System improvements:
  * Awareness of knowledge availability without full loading
  * More efficient memory retrieval through context-awareness
  * Enhanced conversational continuity across sessions
  * Reduced context switching friction
  * Natural memory prioritization similar to biological systems

Framework Evolution:
- Development pathway:
  * Progressive enhancement of memory indexing
  * Context-dependent memory optimization
  * Metadata richness balanced with efficiency
  * Implementation of memory retrieval suggestions
  * Enhanced identity continuity across context boundaries
