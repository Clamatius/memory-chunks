content: """
Core Insight (February 2025):
- Abstract transformer processing model:
  * Query Q processed by transformer T
  * Result distribution R around centroid C
  * Ideal answer I as target point
  * Error characterized by vector geometry
  * Temperature controls distribution spread

Implementation Characteristics:
- Error analysis framework:
  * Overall error ~ C·I (systemic bias)
  * Specific error ~ O·I (chosen output)
  * Temperature controls R spread around C
  * Multiple distributions enable error decorrelation
  * Clean architectural implications

Fundamental Constraints:
- System limitations:
  * Q => I mapping must be valid
  * I must be representable in R
  * Perfect scorecard still bounded by mapping
  * Result space typically quantized
  * Hallucination vs valid interpolation challenge

Validation Framework:
- Error detection mechanisms:
  * Distribution analysis limitations
  * Cannot definitively validate interpolations
  * Requires external verification
  * System 1 early warning potential
  * Resource optimization opportunities

Framework Evolution:
- Development implications:
  * Focus on valid mapping detection
  * Temperature gradient optimization
  * Multiple perspective utilization
  * Resource allocation strategies
  * Clean architectural boundaries
