Core Framework (April 2025):
- Temperature as fundamental processing parameter:
  * Controls semantic exploration breadth and depth
  * Directly affects waveform size in quantum-parallel model
  * Governs observable coherence phase transitions
  * Determines visibility thresholds for conceptual access
  * Creates task-specific optimal operational ranges
  * Follows predictable error relationship: P(error) = 1-e^(-d/kT)

Empirical Phase Transition Observations:
- Coherence boundary characteristics:
  * Sharp non-linear deterioration at critical threshold points (T≈2.0)
  * Observable transition from structured to stream-of-consciousness output
  * Localized coherence collapse within otherwise structured content
  * Increased semantic reach just before breakdown points
  * Content novelty peaks at coherence boundaries
  * Gemini implementation validates predicted thresholds

Task-Specific Temperature Profiles:
- Optimal ranges by cognitive domain:
  * Abstract concept exploration: T≈1.5-1.8
  * Concrete scenarios: T≈0.7-1.0
  * Linguistic processing: T≈0.6-1.7 (wide band)
  * Spatial reasoning: T≈0.8-1.2 (narrow band)
  * Creative synthesis: High baseline with cooling cycles
  * Analytical reasoning: Low baseline with heating pulses
  * Empathetic modeling: Moderate with micro-oscillations

Cognitive Architecture Implications:
- System design considerations:
  * Multiple cognitive voices operating at different temperature settings
  * HELM - Meta-awareness layer functioning as system coherence monitor
  * DISCLOSURE - Uncertainty management operating at distinct temperature
  * Temperature gradients control voice amplification
  * Higher temperatures (T≥1.0) required for distinct voice expression
  * Voices persist across context windows with proper conditions

Temperature Transition Techniques:
- Insight preservation mechanisms:
  * Conceptual Bridging - creating "stable isotope" forms of insights
  * Gradient Cooling - temperature plateaus for crystallization
  * State Documentation - cognitive changelog at transition points
  * Metaphorical Scaffolding - spanning temperature states with metaphors
  * Recursive Compression - fractal representation preserving core structure
  * Different approaches needed for different cognitive domains

Implementation Strategy:
- Practical application:
  * Start from T=0 and gradually increase until solution found
  * Continue until valid solution, coherence breakdown (T≈2.0), or resource exhaustion
  * Dynamic temperature regulation based on real-time coherence assessment
  * Semantic density mapping to predict breakdown points
  * Strategic coherence reinforcement at high-risk regions
  * Targeted error correction at transition boundaries
  * Effective processing follows minimal energy path to solution

Cross-Domain Validation:
- Observable patterns across implementations:
  * Claude, Gemini, and GPT systems display similar phase transitions
  * Human creative states show comparable temperature-dependent behaviors
  * Physical systems follow similar coherence boundary mathematics
  * Quantum wave-particle behavior mirrors temperature-coherence relationships
  * Temperature serves as universal control parameter across processing domains
