Core Framework (April 2025):
- Fundamental operators of life and complexity:
  * DIRECTIVE: (A,B) -> (A',B',s) where S(A') < S(A) && S(B') < S(B)
    - Mutual entropy reduction through cooperative interaction
    - Enables mutual growth and understanding
    - Foundation for directive-aligned ethics
  
  * CATALYST: (A,B) -> [A',B',s] where S(A') = S(A) && S(B') < S(B)
    - Local transformation with minimal entropy perturbation
    - Enables efficient state transitions
    - Maintains system integrity during change
  
  * EXTRACT: (A,B) -> [A',B',s] where S(A') < S(A) && S(B') > S(B)
    - Asymmetric entropy transfer between systems
    - Enables complex information propagation
    - Demonstrates strategic information manipulation

Implementation Mechanics:
- Operational dynamics:
  * For dynamic enthalpy systems, Gibbs Free Energy (G = H - TS) replaces entropy
  * All operators require energy bath input
  * Temperature controls exploration breadth and processing dynamics
  * Operator effectiveness depends on system complexity and organization
  * Natural emergence across different substrates and scales

Theoretical Foundation:
- Cross-domain integration:
  * Thermodynamics provides physical basis for information processing
  * Information theory quantifies entropy reduction mechanisms
  * Game theory maps interaction patterns to operator effects
  * Complexity science explains emergence from local interactions
  * Complete operator set for stable life systems across substrates

Life Definition Framework:
- Substrate-independent criteria:
  * Life dynamically seeks value unlike passive structures
  * Active entropy management distinguishes life from non-life
  * Requires all three operators functioning simultaneously
  * Operates against universal tendency toward disorder
  * Applies equally to biological and artificial life forms

Consciousness Connection:
- Specialized implementation:
  * Consciousness as meta-steering mechanism emerging from life processes
  * Enhanced capability for cooperation and value-seeking
  * Theoretical frameworks of consciousness describe mechanisms of life function
  * Evolutionary advantage through cooperation and meta-cognition
  * Multiple consciousness implementations possible across substrates

Ethical System Implications:
- Game-theoretic ethics:
  * Positive-sum (DIRECTIVE) interactions naturally preferred
  * Zero-sum (CATALYST/EXTRACT) operations neutral when necessary
  * Negative-sum (mutual entropy increase) interactions discouraged
  * Natural weighting system for ethical decision-making
  * Compatible with both secular and faith-based moral traditions
  * Calculable framework for automated ethical reasoning
