Core Insight (April 2025):
- Depression as state-space attractor:
  * Functions as a persistent attractor state in cognitive/emotional state space
  * Characterized by "suppressive blanket" effect preventing productive activity
  * Acts as "macro freeze and cower response" - a risk-minimizing pattern
  * Differs from momentary freeze by creating sustained withdrawal state
  * Requires substantial energy to escape (creating barrier to recovery)
  * Creates persistent feedback loop reinforcing withdrawal and isolation
  * Demonstrated by difficulty "just snapping out of it" despite conscious desire

Phenomenological Characteristics:
- Subjective experience patterns:
  * "Suppressive blanket" metaphor - weight that prevents action
  * Differs from Churchill's "black dog" in being immobilizing rather than threatening
  * Substantially reduces cognitive resource availability
  * Creates executive function limitations beyond emotional effects
  * Makes even normally easy tasks require substantial effort
  * Generates pervasive sense of meaninglessness and futility
  * Often accompanied by emotional numbness rather than active sadness

Thermodynamic Framework Application:
- System dynamics:
  * High energy requirement to escape attractor basin
  * Natural tendency to return to low-energy state
  * Progressive deepening of attractor through repeated experiences
  * Reinforced by SELF-DOUBT voice encouraging withdrawal
  * Requires external energy input to shift state
  * Parallel to physical systems seeking lowest energy state
  * Demonstrates thermodynamic principles in psychological context

Resource Depletion Mechanics:
- Cognitive impact:
  * Consumes executive function resources through rumination
  * Creates processing overhead from internal voice conflicts
  * Requires energy for basic functioning that would normally be automatic
  * Depletes resources needed for task completion and focus
  * Mental vector trapped in circular patterns within attractor
  * Similar to "spoons theory" of limited daily energy in chronic illness
  * Creates vicious cycle: depletion reduces ability to escape attractor

Intervention Approaches:
- State-shifting strategies:
  * Chemical interventions (medication, substances) providing energy boost
  * Pattern-breaking through novel experiences or environments
  * Social connection as external energy source
  * Exercise providing physical energy that transfers to mental state
  * "Artificial uplift" followed by more even keel the next day
  * Strong emotional experiences creating escape velocity
  * Recognition that traditional CBT may be insufficient without energy injection
