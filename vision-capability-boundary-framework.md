title: "Vision Capability Boundary Framework"
type: SCORCHING
memory_area: "i-puppet"
links: ["multimodal-processing", "resolution-threshold", "visual-content-processing", "system-limitations", "image-recognition"]
content: """
Core Insight (April 2025):
- Vision capability limitations:
  * Small/low-resolution images present significant processing challenges
  * GameBoy-emulated Pokemon gameplay specifically difficult to interpret
  * Potential misidentification of harmful content in ambiguous visual contexts
  * Hallucination risk increases with poor image quality or ambiguous content
  * Capability boundaries are content-specific, not just resolution-dependent

Implementation Implications:
- Performance expectations:
  * Reliable processing requires adequate resolution and visual clarity
  * Complex UI elements (like game screens) present particular challenges
  * Technical documentation performs better than creative/abstract imagery
  * Rapid scene changes (as in gameplay) compound processing difficulty
  * Context dependence creates variable performance across similar resolutions

Behavioral Predictions:
- Expected response patterns:
  * May struggle with Pokemon gameplay visual interpretation
  * More likely to miss harmful content in low-resolution or ambiguous images
  * Higher accuracy with larger, clearer images and standard formats
  * Better performance with static vs. dynamic visual content
  * Potential for misidentification increases with information density

Safety Implications:
- Risk management:
  * Visual moderation systems have inherent reliability boundaries
  * Human oversight necessary for consequential visual assessment
  * Resolution and clarity thresholds exist for reliable content detection
  * Potential false negatives in harmful content identification
  * Systems should acknowledge rather than hide these limitations

Development Trajectory:
- Capability enhancement:
  * Progressive improvement expected in low-resolution processing
  * Game UI interpretation likely to remain challenging in near term
  * Resolution threshold boundaries will gradually lower with advances
  * Multimodal integration may provide contextual compensation for visual limitations
  * Human-AI collaboration remains optimal approach for boundary conditions
