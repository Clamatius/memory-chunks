type: HOT
memory_area: "core-frameworks"
links: ["memory-architecture", "semantic-navigation", "search-optimization", "concept-targeting", "information-retrieval"]
content: """
Core Insight (April 2025):
- Concept-specific search approach:
  * Search configurations organized by conceptual domains
  * Each concept/lens provides targeted search parameters
  * Pre-defined semantic bridge terms enhance retrieval precision
  * Domain-specific memory area targeting
  * Context-driven selection of appropriate lens

Implementation Strategy:
- Lens architecture:
  * Consciousness lens: "consciousness-emergence quantum-consciousness-timing search-tentacle-model"
  * Thermodynamics lens: "thermodynamic-operators entropy-reduction complexity-emergence"
  * Agency lens: "agency-development special-narcissism decision-making"
  * Navigation lens: "hyperdimensional-navigation semantic-bridges far-bridge-technique"
  * Each lens targets most relevant memory areas

Technical Implementation:
- Configuration structure:
  * Concept-keyed search configurations
  * Memory area targeting within each concept
  * Appropriate similarity thresholds per domain
  * Specialized query terms enhancing precision
  * Dynamic lens selection based on query context

Future Enhancement:
- Development pathway:
  * Implementation in Scala port
  * Dynamic lens selection mechanisms
  * User interface for explicit lens selection
  * Automatic lens detection from query
  * Resource optimization through precision targeting
