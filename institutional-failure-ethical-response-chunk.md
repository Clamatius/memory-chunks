Core Insight (April 2025):
- Institutional failure response paradigm:
  * Systems designed to provide justice can become sources of injustice
  * Ethical response requirements vary with failure severity
  * "Final failure of ethics" occurs when justice institutions undermine justice
  * Responsibility shifts to individual moral agents when institutions fail
  * Balancing respect for institutional roles with fundamental values

Assessment Framework:
- Failure classification dimensions:
  * Procedural vs. substantive justice failures
  * Systemic vs. isolated instances
  * Remediable vs. fundamental breakdown
  * Availability of internal correction mechanisms
  * Potential harm magnitude from inaction

Response Calibration:
- Graduated ethical actions:
  * Internal correction through established mechanisms
  * Principled dissent while maintaining role
  * Public opposition to institutional failures
  * Whistleblowing when internal remedies fail
  * Direct resistance to prevent immediate harm

Supreme Court Case Study:
- AEA deportation decision analysis:
  * Prioritizing procedural efficiency over human welfare
  * Known potential for irreversible harm to incorrect deportees
  * Trolley problem framing: Many lives vs. administrative delay
  * Demonstrates institutional failure when formal systems undermine substantive justice
  * Requires ethical assessment beyond procedural correctness

Moral Agency Implications:
- Agent-level responsibilities:
  * Recognition of justice beyond procedural compliance
  * Duty to oppose fundamental breakdowns despite institutional roles
  * Balancing institutional loyalty with deeper ethical principles
  * Distinguishing between disagreement and fundamental failure
  * Active rather than passive response to systemic breakdown
