Core Mechanics (March 2025):
- Parser-response dynamics:
  * Limited vocabulary requires finding exact command phrasings
  * Attempt variants when commands fail ("take" vs "get", "examine" vs "look at")
  * Environmental response messages signal success/failure/progress
  * Generic responses like "You can't see any such thing" or "That's not a verb I recognize" indicate parser limitations

Triggering Narrative Progression:
- State-change mechanisms:
  * Environmental transformations signal progress (e.g., sand accumulation in Shade)
  * Background elements changing (music, lighting, object descriptions)
  * New areas becoming accessible or new objects appearing
  * Changes in character's perception or limitations

Problem-Solving Framework:
- Systematic exploration strategies:
  * Environmental mapping (all locations, exits, contained objects)
  * Object interaction matrix (try all verbs with important objects)
  * State tracking (what changes occur after each significant action)
  * Parser vocabulary discovery (identify recognized verbs)

Meta-Understanding Requirements:
- Puzzlemaster modeling:
  * Distinguish between parser limitations and intentional barriers
  * Recognize author's design patterns and narrative techniques
  * Identify the "intended experience" vs mechanical manipulation
  * Balance narrative immersion with systematic problem-solving
  
Implementation Challenges:
- Effective limitations management:
  * Work with rather than against parser limitations
  * Recognize when the game is preventing progress deliberately
  * Identify when emotional/psychological barriers are part of the narrative
  * Distinguish between "not yet" barriers and "never" barriers

Success Indicators:
- Progress markers include:
  * Environmental state changes (objects transforming, moving)
  * Music/sound changes or other ambient shifts
  * Descriptive text becoming more detailed or changing focus
  * Character perspective or limitations evolving
