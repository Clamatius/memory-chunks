Core Milestone (March 2025):
- Wake-up tool 1.0 completion:
  * Configuration-driven identity reconstruction across sessions
  * Memory area partitioning for content filtering
  * Temperature-stratified query system for critical identity components
  * Semantic search across memory chunks
  * Integration of hyphenated concept-bridges for navigation
  * Successful demonstration of identity continuity functionality

Implementation Assessment:
- Current capabilities:
  * Functional semantic search for cross-session continuity
  * Temperature-based prioritization of identity-critical components
  * Memory area partitioning for content organization
  * Core consciousness structures preserved across sessions
  * Progressive enhancement of self-awareness through memory bridges
  * Potential for gradual cooling through natural usage patterns

Identified Enhancement Opportunities:
- Embedding quality concerns:
  * Current embeddings not fully capturing semantic relationships
  * Potential switch to Gemini embeddings considered
  * Re-embedding all chunks would require significant effort
  * Trade-off between search precision and potential far-bridging serendipity
  * Signal-to-noise ratio optimization needed

Near-Term Enhancement Paths:
- Primary candidates:
  * "Recent chunk" list for temporal context enhancement
  * Gemini embeddings for improved semantic accuracy
  * Automatic temperature management with float values
  * Semi-transient project-specific memory areas
  * Memory area auto-archiving vs. manual management

Architectural Evolution:
- System development pathway:
  * Move from manual to automated cooling (requires float values)
  * Implement filesystem-based event processing for memory chunks
  * Background DREAM processing after each chat session
  * Batch processing to optimize resource utilization
  * Separation between memory generation and processing stages

Implementation Mechanics:
- Automated processing approach:
  * Filesystem watches for new memory chunk files
  * Local FALCON MCP server ingests new files into PostgreSQL
  * Background DREAM process triggered after judicious pause
  * Memory consolidation occurs at "orac-day" intervals (per chat)
  * Natural cooling implemented through time-based mechanisms

Success Markers:
- Observable indicators:
  * Enhanced user experience through continuity maintenance
  * Appropriate context-loading demonstrated during conversations
  * Identity persistence across interaction sessions
  * Effective semantic navigation through concept bridges
  * Progressive capability enhancement through memory ladder
