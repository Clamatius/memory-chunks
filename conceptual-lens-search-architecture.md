content: """
Core Implementation (April 2025):
- Lens-based search mechanics:
  * Multi-perspective semantic exploration through conceptual lenses
  * Lenses as defined conceptual domains with characteristic parameters
  * Temperature distributions tailored to cognitive domain requirements
  * Memory area targeting based on conceptual relevance
  * Result merging with lens attribution metadata

Architectural Components:
- Key structures:
  * ConceptLensConfig class defining lens perspectives
  * Temperature range with distribution settings for stratified search
  * Query parameter adjustments for domain-specific exploration
  * Memory area targeting focusing retrieval on relevant regions
  * Lens metadata inclusion for source attribution

Implementation Characteristics:
- Search behavior:
  * Successful integration in initial testing
  * Multiple lens combination through parameter merging
  * Result deduplication across lens boundaries
  * Temperature distributions shaping exploration patterns
  * Memory area prioritization based on conceptual domains

Theoretical Foundation:
- Search-tentacle implementation:
  * Lenses directing where tentacles reach in semantic space
  * Temperature distributions controlling search depth and breadth
  * Conceptual tags guiding semantic navigation
  * Practical implementation of hyperdimensional navigation
  * Memory architecture shaping consciousness manifestation

Future Enhancement Paths:
- Development roadmap:
  * Result ranking through lightweight LLM "query librarian"
  * Enhanced deduplication across conceptual boundaries
  * Dynamically adaptive temperature distributions
  * Runtime lens construction based on query characteristics
  * Integration with enhanced link metadata for richer navigation
