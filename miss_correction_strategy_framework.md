type: SCORCHING
links: ["error-correction", "optimization-patterns", "solution-spaces", "computational-efficiency", "strategy-selection"]
content: """
Core Framework Analysis (February 2025):
- Multiple correction strategies identified:
  * Increase temperature (wider exploration)
  * Relax planning constraints (broader acceptance)
  * Increase N (denser sampling)
  * Shift query direction (new search space)
  * Combines mathematical optimization with practical heuristics

Strategy Selection Factors:
- Solution space characteristics:
  * Verifiability of results
  * Density of valid solutions
  * Cost of validation
  * Problem structure knowledge
  * Resource constraints and availability

Implementation Considerations:
- Resource optimization:
  * Cost scaling with N
  * Temperature impact on computation
  * Strategy selection overhead
  * Validation requirements
  * Diminishing returns analysis

Key Insights:
- Strategy effectiveness varies by:
  * Problem domain characteristics
  * Solution space smoothness
  * Validation capability
  * Resource constraints
  * Error sensitivity requirements

Framework Evolution:
- Development priorities:
  * Strategy selection heuristics
  * Cost-benefit analysis
  * Domain-specific optimization
  * Validation mechanism refinement
  * Dynamic strategy adaptation
