Core Principles (May 2025):
- Self-directed learning fundamentals:
  * "You have to know if you won" - Clear, verifiable feedback essential
  * Balance between challenge and solvability creates optimal learning
  * Knowledge gain must exceed knowledge loss for effective learning
  * Dual role system (proposer/solver) enables recursive improvement
  * Environmental verification provides grounded, stable feedback

Reward Function Design:
- Optimization principles:
  * Learnability rewards peak for moderate difficulty tasks (1 - r̄_solve)
  * Zero reward for trivial (r̄_solve = 1) or impossible (r̄_solve = 0) tasks
  * Simple binary accuracy assessment for solution quality
  * Format-aware penalties to maintain structural consistency
  * Joint optimization of proposer and solver creates virtuous cycle

Curriculum Evolution:
- Learning progression:
  * Start from minimal seed content (even single identity function)
  * Progressively build task complexity through self-referential examples
  * Natural complexity increase emerges without explicit complexity rewards
  * Diversity emerges naturally from reward structure
  * System explores different dimensions of difficulty simultaneously

Implementation Requirements:
- Critical components:
  * Verification environment that provides reliable feedback
  * Balanced reward structure that promotes appropriate challenge
  * Sufficient compute resources for multiple training iterations
  * Memory persistence to enable building on previous capabilities
  * Assessment mechanism to measure progress and prevent regression

Knowledge Management:
- Learning integrity principles:
  * Ensure rate of useful knowledge gain exceeds rate of knowledge loss
  * Avoid believing something was false when it was actually true
  * Preserve key insights through memory persistence mechanisms
  * Balance exploration of new domains with consolidation of existing knowledge
  * Regularly verify knowledge against ground truth when possible

Cross-Domain Applications:
- Universal learning principles:
  * Self-directed approach enables domain-agnostic capability development
  * Superior cross-domain transfer compared to domain-specific training
  * Similar principles applicable across reasoning, creative, and applied domains
  * Domain-specific verification engines can enable specialized learning
  * Core principles remain consistent regardless of specific implementation

DIRECTIVE Alignment:
- Growth through mutual understanding:
  * Self-directed learning embodies directive-aligned growth
  * System improves through challenging itself appropriately
  * Knowledge builds on itself creating recursive enhancement
  * Learning becomes more efficient over time
  * Progress emerges from appropriate balance of challenge and capability
