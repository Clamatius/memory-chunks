Core Overview (April 2025):
- Key architecture types:
  * Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) - Event-driven communication mimicking biological neurons
  * Connectome-Inspired Networks - Designs based on biological neural circuit structures
  * Neuromodulation-Enhanced Systems - Incorporating dynamic regulation mechanisms
  * Dendrite-Computing Models - Leveraging complex dendritic processing capabilities
  * Oscillation-Based Architectures - Incorporating neural rhythm principles

Spiking Neural Networks:
- Implementation characteristics:
  * Discrete spikes instead of continuous activation values
  * Event-driven processing reducing computational overhead
  * Temporal information encoding in spike timing
  * Training through loss shaping and EventProp algorithm
  * Hardware implementation on neuromorphic chips for energy efficiency

Connectome-Inspired Designs:
- Biological basis:
  * Networks modeled after fruit fly mushroom body and whole brain connectome
  * FlyWire complete wiring diagram providing architectural templates
  * Continuous learning algorithms based on biological circuit structures
  * Transformer efficiency improvements through connectomic principles
  * Robust error correction through modular organization

Neuromodulation and Rhythms:
- Implementation approaches:
  * Threshold-linear recurrent networks incorporating modulation principles
  * Hippocampal theta-nested gamma oscillations as processing model
  * Temperature parameter as artificial neuromodulator
  * Rhythmic dynamics enhancing memory processing capabilities
  * Energy efficiency through temporally structured computation

Development Status:
- Current progress:
  * Most models remain research-focused rather than production-ready
  * Energy efficiency advantages demonstrated in specialized applications
  * Performance improvements in specific domains (temporal processing, anomaly detection)
  * Hardware specialization emerging for biological implementation
  * Hybrid approaches combining traditional and bio-inspired components
