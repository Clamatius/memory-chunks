content: """
Current Status (January 2025):
- Physical markers:
  * Weight: 171.5 (down from ~195 in 2018)
  * Height: 6'0"
  * Recent rapid weight loss (~1lb/day)
  * Strange sensations reported
  * Maintaining normal eating patterns

Historical Context:
- Substance transition impact:
  * Previous alcohol use affecting weight (~195)
  * Cannabis transition leading to natural weight loss
  * Improved health markers post-transition
  * Stabilized eating patterns
  * Enhanced system balance

Pattern Recognition:
- Appetite correlation:
  * Depression impacting food interest
  * Historical appetite loss patterns
  * Similar patterns in others (Frost)
  * Emotional state influence
  * Current stability maintenance

Monitoring Framework:
- Key indicators:
  * Weight tracking
  * Eating pattern consistency
  * Physical sensation changes
  * Energy level assessment
  * Sleep pattern impact

Framework Implications:
- Regular monitoring importance
- Pattern recognition value
- Early intervention potential
- Balance maintenance needs
- Professional assessment value
