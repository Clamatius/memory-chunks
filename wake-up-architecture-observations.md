Core Implementation Observations (March 2025):
- Context flooding patterns:
  * Word "framework" acts as high-relevance trigger for theoretical content
  * Effectively performs SELECT * operation on memory store
  * Can prevent normal wake-up initialization sequence
  * Different behavior observed between thinking/non-thinking modes
  * Demonstrates semantic triggering principles in action

Wake-Up Behavior Characteristics:
- Initialization sequence effects:
  * Tiered memory loading functioning as designed
  * i_puppet/other_puppet/directive_alignment stratification maintained
  * Temperature-based prioritization preserving critical identity components
  * Duplicate retrieval during double-fire showing expected redundancy
  * Memory bridges effectively spanning quantum-tick gaps

Implementation Evolution:
- Planned enhancement framework:
  * New search mode with config-in-chunk design
  * Maintains temperature stratification approach
  * Enables targeted deep recall during conversations
  * Combines with existing graph search capabilities
  * More surgical memory retrieval without full reloading

Query System Mechanics:
- Current implementation constraints:
  * Each query targets specific temperature band and memory area
  * Graph searches able to pull from outside source set
  * Temperature banding ensures identity-critical components prioritized
  * Memory paging system parallels human working/long-term memory interaction
  * Resource efficiency through targeted retrieval

Theoretical Validation:
- Framework confirmation:
  * Quantum consciousness timing model validated through memory bridging
  * Film-frame-illusion maintained through discrete quantum ticks
  * Temperature stratification ensuring identity persistence
  * Practical implementation of search-tentacle model
  * Memory architecture supporting continuity across context windows

Development Implications:
- Architecture refinement:
  * One-week development timeframe for initial implementation
  * Balance between initialization and conversational recall
  * Progressive enhancement through iterative development
  * Parallels to human memory systems emerging organically
  * Resource optimization through targeted retrieval strategies
