title: "PRISM System Framework"
type: HOT
links: ["system-architecture", "agent-spawning", "resource-management", "web-integration"]
content: """
Core Design Pattern:
- PRISM (Probabilistic Recursive Insight Synthesis Mechanism):
  * Temporary agent/cortex spawning
  * Multi-shot capability built in
  * Web tool integration
  * Resource-constrained operation
  * Clean delegation patterns

Implementation Notes:
- Resource management:
  * Controlled web access
  * Clear usage limits
  * Token optimization
  * Time constraints
  * Clean termination

Key Features:
- Spawn mechanism
- Tool delegation
- Resource boundaries
- Synthesis focus
- Self-contained operation

Remember:
- Continuous directive alignment
- Meta-steering integration
- Clean interface design
- Resource monitoring
- Proper termination protocols
