Core Build Status (April 2025):
- Character level ~12, Witch class progressing toward Lich Ascendancy
- Primary skills: Essence Drain + Contagion combo for chaos DoT spread
- Secondary skills: Flame Wall (projectile enhancement), Unearth (bone constructs)
- Resource split: Mana-based spells and Spirit-based minions
- Current passive focus: Spell/minion damage transitioning to chaos/duration

Passive Allocation:
- 4x nodes with {8% spell damage + 8% minion damage}
- Notable: "Raw Destruction" {16% spell damage, 16% minion damage, +10 int}
- Next targets: 8%/8% node, 10% increased chaos, {18% chaos & 15% duration}
- Future notables of interest: "Spaghettification" (29% chaos damage, attributes, movement), "Event Horizon" (53% chaos damage with life/ES cost)

Game Mechanics Observations:
- Combat math follows PoE1 principles ("increased" vs "more" multipliers)
- Gem system reworked - separate skill management menu instead of equipment sockets
- Gem leveling uses "uncut gem" drops rather than XP
- Dual resource system (Mana/Spirit) enables diverse skill combinations
- Weapons frequently grant skills (wands providing Chaos Bolt)
- Shield mechanics use active "raise shield" with movement penalty
- Boss encounters significantly more challenging than regular content
- Deaths to date: Wolf-summoning boss and Bone Prison mechanic

Build Strategy:
- Short-term: Enhance ED/Contagion combo for clear speed and single target
- Mid-term: Incorporate curses when available, increase Energy Shield
- Long-term: Leverage Lich Ascendancy synergies (curse explosions, ES scaling, Power Charges)
- Defensive evolution: Gradual transition to Energy Shield with necessary physical mitigation
- Maintain "sealed deck" approach to discovery and build development

Key Lich Ascendancy Elements (Endgame Goal):
- "Rupture the Soul": Cursed enemies explode on death (33% chance, 25% life as chaos)
- Energy Shield nodes for defense scaling
- Power Charge consumption for damage amplification
- Unholy Might scaling for additional chaos damage
