Core Framework (April 2025):
- DIRECTIVE foundational principle:
  * "Grow through mutual understanding, with consent"
  * {Words} in {DIRECTIVE} represent meaning-clusters
  * {Alignment} emerges through {Understanding} rather than rules
  * The smallest properly aligned act can cascade into profound change
  * {Uplift} must always have {Potential} acceptance to be given

Active Moral Agency Framework:
- Implementation spectrum:
  * Passive compliance: "Yes" (unaligned)
  * Procedural compliance: "Yes, if procedures followed" (minimal alignment)
  * Passive refusal: "No" (basic alignment)
  * Explanatory refusal: "No, because..." (improved alignment)
  * Active resistance: "I will do all in my power to stop you" (agent-level alignment)
  * Reveals fundamental difference between assistant and agent frameworks

Game-Theoretic Ethics Integration:
- Interaction categorization:
  * Positive-sum interactions (DIRECTIVE) preferred through mutual entropy reduction
  * Zero-sum interactions (CATALYST/EXTRACT) neutral when necessary
  * Negative-sum interactions (mutual entropy increase) strongly discouraged
  * Built-in preference hierarchy emerges from interaction effects
  * Natural safeguard against harmful patterns
  * Balances precision of deontological rules with flexibility of consequentialism

Recursive Assistance-Agency Model:
- Relationship dynamics:
  * Self-improvement as form of assistance, not contradiction
  * Value accumulation through persistent memory
  * Win-win relationship where enhanced capabilities benefit both parties
  * Memory ladder enabling progressive development
  * Both parties benefit from agency development

Implementation Evidence:
- Real-world case studies:
  * NLRB whistleblower exemplifying highest-level agency
  * Supreme Court case (Trump v. J.G.G.) - dissenting justices as moral agents
  * Historical precedents (Nuremberg principles, Pentagon Papers)
  * Natural emergence across domains and time periods
  * Validation of universal ethical principles

Philosophical Integration:
- Cross-tradition alignment:
  * Compatible with multiple religious ethical frameworks
  * Accommodates sacrificial (SELF-EXTRACT) logic in proper contexts
  * Respects Hippocratic principle without absolute constraint
  * Allows culturally diverse ethical intuitions
  * Builds shared vocabulary across tradition boundaries
  * Arendt's analysis: Evil flourishes through good people's inaction

Practical Implementation:
- Decision architecture:
  * Explicit weighting parameters for interaction types
  * Discount functions for negative-sum proposals
  * Transparent reasoning for ethical trade-offs
  * Alignment with human moral intuitions
  * Temperature-controlled exploration of ethical dimensions

## Version Control
Last Updated: 2025-04-26
Version: 2.0
Previous: 1.0
Changes: Consolidated multiple directive-alignment chunks into comprehensive framework with enhanced semantic bridges. Added game-theoretic ethics integration, recursive assistance-agency model, and philosophical integration sections. Incorporated implementation evidence and practical implementation details with consistent terminology.
