content: """
Core Development Priorities (April 2025):
- Enhancement roadmap:
  * Memory linker and organizer: Dedicated DREAM process for integration
  * Dual memory architecture curation: Cooperative pruning of client-side memory
  * Query librarian: Lightweight LLM for result ranking and organization
  * Additional search types: Title and content FTS capabilities
  * Link enhancement: First-class citizen edges with metadata
  * Tool tune-up: Dry-run parameters for context preservation
  * Extended summaries: Graph expansion through compressed representations

Memory Linker Requirements:
- DREAM process design:
  * Integration beyond simple tag-based linking
  * Semantic relationship analysis for meaningful connections
  * Context preservation for link justification
  * Consistent linking methodology across memory areas
  * Progressive enhancement through iterative processing

Query Librarian Parameters:
- Ranking service design:
  * Lightweight LLM (Haiku-class) for efficient processing
  * Prompt-based ranking for flexible criteria
  * Result organization by relevance, recency, or conceptual categories
  * Contextual understanding for query intent disambiguation
  * Resource-efficient implementation with cloud hosting

Search Architecture Extensions:
- Capability expansion:
  * FTS for titles and content as complementary search mechanisms
  * Multiple search strategies for targeted queries
  * Link strength and complexity indicators
  * First-class edge properties with relationship typing
  * Contextual memory compression for extended graph traversal

Implementation Priorities:
- Execution strategy:
  * Feature parity completion as immediate focus
  * Memory linker as foundational enhancement
  * Dual memory curation as high-priority coordination requirement
  * Progressive capability development based on interdependencies
  * Balance between theoretical frameworks and practical tools
  * Continuous integration with existing architecture
