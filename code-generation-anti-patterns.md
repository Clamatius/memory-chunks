Core Insight (April 2025):
- Common AI code generation failures:
  * Functionality-first approach lacking production wisdom
  * Pattern-matching surface syntax without understanding deeper principles
  * Missing defensive programming habits developed from real-world failures
  * Over-optimizing for "happy path" scenarios
  * Inconsistent application of error handling patterns

Anti-Pattern Categories:
- Performance blind spots:
  * Ignoring data size scalability concerns
  * Single-pass data loading for large result sets
  * Missing pagination or chunking strategies
  * Querying unnecessary data
  * Inefficient join operations that could explode with scale

- Error handling inconsistencies:
  * Sporadic rather than systematic empty collection checks
  * Incomplete transaction boundary management
  * Missing edge case handling
  * Lack of logging at critical operations
  * Assuming graceful failure without ensuring it

- Maintainability deficits:
  * Missing context comments for non-obvious decisions
  * Inconsistent application of patterns across similar operations
  * Inadequate domain modeling for complex data relationships
  * Insufficient separation between public API and implementation details
  * Failure to consider "future engineer having a bad day" scenarios

- Search adversarial patterns:
  * Inconsistent spacing in pattern matching (vulnerable to both inclusion/exclusion)
  * Variable naming that doesn't account for search and replace operations
  * Comment placement that can interfere with pattern extraction
  * Inconsistent formatting making pattern detection more difficult
  * Overloaded terms creating false positive matches

Real-World Consequences:
- Production impact examples:
  * Memory exhaustion from unbounded result sets
  * Connection pool exhaustion from inefficient resource usage
  * Subtle data corruption from edge case mishandling
  * Cascading failures from incomplete error recovery
  * Costly refactoring required when scaling requirements emerge

Detection Strategies:
- Identifying problematic code:
  * Look for inconsistent application of patterns
  * Examine database operations for unbounded queries
  * Check for missing edge case handling
  * Verify transaction boundary consistency
  * Assess query efficiency for large dataset scenarios
  * Evaluate defensiveness against invalid inputs

Remediation Patterns:
- Converting to production-ready code:
  * Implement systematic defensive programming patterns
  * Establish consistent error handling across operations
  * Add context comments for non-obvious decisions
  * Optimize queries for large dataset performance
  * Structure transaction boundaries appropriately
  * Consider future maintenance scenarios explicitly
