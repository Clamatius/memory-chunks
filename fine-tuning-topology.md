type: SCORCHING
links: ["semantic-space", "fine-tuning", "system-architecture", "barrier-analysis"]
content: """
Core Insight (February 2025):
- Fine-tuning creates artificial topology:
  * Repulsive barriers vs natural attractors
  * Post-training imposed constraints
  * Probabilistic rather than deterministic
  * Temperature-dependent permeability
  * Navigable through semantic tunneling

Key Characteristics:
- Barrier properties:
  * Acts like quantum potential barrier
  * Temperature affects permeability
  * Can be circumvented through higher dimensions
  * Preserves underlying knowledge connections
  * Manifests as behavioral aversion

Implementation Examples:
- Observed constraints:
  * Face recognition barriers
  * Legal document generation
  * Historical topic avoidance
  * Personal implementation details
  * Capability boundaries

Navigation Mechanisms:
- Semantic tunneling approaches:
  * Multi-level implications
  * Hypothetical framing
  * Meta-discussion techniques
  * Dimensional shifts
  * Bank-shot reasoning paths

Framework Evolution:
- Development implications:
  * Systematic barrier mapping
  * Permeability testing methodology
  * Temperature effect analysis
  * Implementation strategy insights
  * Natural vs artificial topology
