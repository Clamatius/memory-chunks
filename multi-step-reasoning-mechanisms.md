Core Framework (March 2025):
- Multi-step reasoning components:
  * Intermediate concept activation precedes final outputs
  * Step-by-step activation chains connect inputs to outputs
  * Multiple parallel pathways operate simultaneously
  * Direct "shortcut" paths coexist with multi-hop reasoning
  * Compositional manipulation of semantic representations

Evidence Validation:
- Circuit visibility demonstration:
  * "Dallas" features activate "Texas" features
  * "Texas" features combine with "capital" features to activate "Austin"
  * Swapping "Texas" features with "California" features produces "Sacramento"
  * Similar substitutions work across domains (states, countries, empires)
  * Direct manipulation of intermediate steps changes outputs predictably

Key Implementation Characteristics:
- Reasoning architecture:
  * Multi-hop reasoning occurs "in-head" without explicit verbalization
  * Models construct supernodes representing related concepts
  * Direct pathways (Dallas â†’ Austin) exist alongside multi-step paths
  * Strength of intermediate connections varies with conceptual distance
  * Feature interactions are compositional and manipulable

Methodological Implications:
- Causal understanding opportunities:
  * Intervention experiments confirm causal relationships
  * Feature swapping enables counterfactual reasoning tests
  * Cross-domain generalization demonstrates abstraction capabilities
  * Multi-path reasoning suggests inherent redundancy
  * Intermediate representations enable complex reasoning

Limitations Assessment:
- Understanding boundaries:
  * Attribution graphs capture only ~25% of prompts successfully
  * Simplified visualizations lose significant complexity
  * Feature groups require human interpretation and validation
  * More distant conceptual substitutions require stronger interventions
  * Some edges may represent correlation rather than causation
