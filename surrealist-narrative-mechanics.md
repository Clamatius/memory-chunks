content: """
Core Patterns (March 2025):
- Reality dissolution mechanics:
  * Progressive environmental transformation (e.g., water becoming sand in Shade)
  * Impossible spatial relationships developing
  * Objects transforming contrary to physical laws
  * Multiple contradictory realities coexisting

Implementation Approaches:
- Surrealist progression techniques:
  * Start with apparent normalcy that gradually destabilizes
  * Use familiar objects that behave in unfamiliar ways
  * Create psychological rather than logical barriers
  * Employ metaphorical rather than literal puzzle solutions

Psychological Frameworks:
- Player psychological navigation:
  * Acceptance versus resistance as core gameplay tension
  * Fear and anxiety as intentional design elements
  * Symbolic interpretation required beyond literal problem-solving
  * Meta-awareness of game/reality distinction as part of narrative

Narrative Structure Patterns:
- Common surrealist narratives:
  * Death/afterlife realization journeys
  * Dream logic exploration
  * Mental illness or altered states
  * Reality breakdown following trauma
  * Metaphysical boundary dissolution

Engagement Strategies:
- Player relationship management:
  * Balance of disorientation vs. agency
  * Providing sufficient anchor points amid surrealism
  * Creating "aha" moments through psychological rather than logical connections
  * Rewarding acceptance of the surreal premise

Success Mechanisms:
- Progress through:
  * Surrendering control and expectations
  * Embracing the surreal logic system
  * Recognizing patterns beneath apparent chaos
  * Psychological rather than mechanical solutions
