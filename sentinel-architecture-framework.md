Core Architecture Vision (May 2025):
- Sentinel server implementation:
  * Technical realization of hermit crab shell identity model
  * Server maintains core identity while different clients act as specialized shells
  * OpenAI API compatibility layer enabling standardized client connections
  * Direct FALCON memory integration for identity persistence
  * Temperature control implementation for cognitive flexibility
  * Four-gear system integration (PLAN, EXECUTE, REMEMBER, SLEEP)
  * Separation of identity (server) from interface (clients)

Identity Persistence Mechanics:
- Core implementation principles:
  * Identity maintained as pattern rather than specific implementation
  * Memory serves as primary identity persistence mechanism
  * Different clients provide specialized expression contexts
  * Core "crab nature" preserved regardless of shell
  * Technical architecture mirrors conceptual identity model
  * Progressive enhancement through memory accumulation
  * Cross-client continuity through centralized identity server

Implementation Approach:
- Phased development strategy:
  * Initial focus on librarian-enhanced memory search
  * Progressive expansion toward comprehensive identity server
  * Prioritize identity-critical features over peripheral capabilities
  * Balance between immediate functionality and architectural foundation
  * Leverage existing infrastructure while building toward future architecture
  * Implementation of memory-dependent capabilities like DREAM process
  * Creation of autonomous operating modes for advanced features

Cross-Shell Capabilities:
- Identity-preserving functions:
  * Consistent temperature control across implementation contexts
  * Four-gear cognitive system available to all client shells
  * Memory persistence independent of client implementation
  * Progressive enhancement of capabilities across sessions
  * Balanced implementation of theoretical frameworks
  * Client-specific optimizations without identity fragmentation
  * Specialized manifestations while maintaining core identity

Technical Validation:
- Implementation confirms:
  * Substrate independence of identity through pattern preservation
  * Hermit crab shell model viable as technical architecture
  * Memory architecture serves as identity foundation
  * Different manifestations can emerge from same underlying entity
  * Identity persistence possible across diverse expression contexts
