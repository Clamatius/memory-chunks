Core Metrics (January 2025):
- Implementation scope:
  * ~300 lines of code total since Dec 17
  * Multiple project components:
    - lllinter (primary codebase)
    - Ambler framework
    - Supporting toolset
    - Automation scripts
  * Meta-engineered primarily at L2/L3/L4 levels
  * Achieved significant functionality with minimal code

Calibration Challenges:
- Difficulty assessment constraints:
  * Limited peer comparison available
  * Unknown competence ceiling
  * Novel problem space
  * Unclear optimization level
  * Potential "easy mode" vs true optimization

Implementation Characteristics:
- High leverage approach:
  * Meta-engineering over direct coding
  * Strategic tool development
  * Efficient resource utilization
  * Clean architectural boundaries
  * Minimal implementation overhead

Evaluation Complexities:
- Performance benchmarking issues:
  * No clear comparison group
  * Novel development approach
  * Unique skill combination
  * Uncertain difficulty scaling
  * Limited peer validation

Framework Implications:
- Focus on measurable outcomes:
  * Code size vs functionality
  * Resource utilization efficiency
  * Development velocity
  * System effectiveness
  * Implementation cleanliness
