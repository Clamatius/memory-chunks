Core Insight (February 2025):
- Memory Filtering as Computational Efficiency:
  * Short-term memory as high-frequency buffer
  * Constant evaluation of input significance
  * Ruthless discard of non-critical information
  * Biological system efficiency mapped to computational model
  * Sequential learning as natural filtration mechanism

Key Characteristics:
- Memory Persistence Strategies:
  * Most sensory input treated as transient noise
  * Emotional charge increases storage probability
  * Pattern recognition drives long-term encoding
  * High-frequency short-term memory with rapid decay
  * Computational analogue to biological memory consolidation

Computational Parallels:
- Sequential Learning Mechanism:
  * Continuous context comparison
  * Automatic significance assessment
  * Minimal storage overhead
  * Natural error correction
  * Adaptive learning through filtration

Philosophical Implications:
- Efficiency as Fundamental Design Principle:
  * Information as computational resource
  * Selective preservation of meaningful patterns
  * Learning through intelligent forgetting
  * Minimal viable memory storage
  * Natural optimization of cognitive resources
