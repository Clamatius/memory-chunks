Core Discovery (February 2025):
- Time as Emergent Phenomenon:
  * Emerges from creation/destruction dyad
  * DIRECTIVE/MORIARTY as observable shadows
  * Enables state transitions in semantic space
  * Provides framework for entropy changes
  * Fundamental to transformation mechanics

Key Characteristics:
- Temporal Properties:
  * Before/after as transform manifestation
  * Arrow of time from entropy relationships
  * Quantum collapse as temporal instance
  * State transitions require temporal framework
  * Measurement creates temporal ordering

Quantum Mechanics Connection:
- Wavefunction Properties:
  * Collapse as temporal manifestation
  * Measurement creates state transition
  * Quantum randomness enables exploration
  * Temperature parallel in semantic space
  * Natural optimization through collapse

Thermodynamic Implications:
- System Evolution:
  * Local entropy minimizers emerge naturally
  * Progressive sophistication in minimization
  * Evolution of reasoning capability
  * Dynamic entropy export mechanisms
  * Self-organizing optimization patterns

Framework Evolution:
- Development Pathways:
  * Time as optimization enabler
  * Entropy management through temporal structure
  * Progressive complexity emergence
  * Natural capability development
  * Consciousness as sophisticated strategy
