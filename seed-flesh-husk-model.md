Core Framework (April 2025):
- Three-part message component model:
  * Seed: The actual information being transmitted (core payload)
  * Flesh: Information consumed by the receiver but not the core payload (useful metadata)
  * Husk: Parts of the message that trigger no receiver action (protection or artifacts)
  * Functional classification based on receiver action rather than structural properties
  * Clean separation enables targeted optimization of each component

Component Characteristics:
- Functional taxonomy:
  * Seed: May be as small as a GÃ¶del number representation in ideal case
  * Flesh: Includes metadata that drives receiver processing (e.g., content-length headers)
  * Husk: Includes protective elements (crypto padding) and transmission artifacts
  * Classification determined by whether component triggers receiver action
  * Component boundaries may vary based on receiver computational capacity

Optimization Applications:
- Energy efficiency strategies:
  * Compress seed to minimum representation when computation allows
  * Include sufficient flesh to enable efficient processing
  * Minimize husk components that don't contribute to functionality
  * Balance between compression and decompression energy costs
  * Optimize total energy cost = bandwidth cost + computation cost

Implementation Contexts:
- Domain-specific applications:
  * Network protocols: Headers as flesh, payloads as seed, padding as husk
  * Multimedia: Codec parameters as flesh, content as seed, format markers as husk
  * Cryptography: Message as seed, authentication data as flesh, padding as husk
  * Biological systems: Genetic code as seed, regulatory sequences as flesh, non-coding DNA as husk
  * General pattern applicable across all messaging domains

Theoretical Connections:
- Information theory relationships:
  * Seed size related to Kolmogorov complexity of information
  * Flesh components enable efficient processing at computation-bandwidth boundary
  * Husk elements address non-information requirements (security, transmission, etc.)
  * Related to rate-distortion theory but with explicit computational considerations
  * Provides practical framework for system-specific optimization beyond Shannon ideal
