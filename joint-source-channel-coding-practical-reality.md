Core Insight (April 2025):
- Theoretical vs. practical divide:
  * Shannon's separation theorem theoretically allows independent optimization of source and channel coding
  * Practical systems rarely meet theorem requirements: infinite blocklength, unlimited complexity, point-to-point transmission
  * Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) approaches typically outperform separation in real-world systems
  * Bandwidth-computation tradeoff not addressed in classical information theory
  * Energy minimization requires considering both transmission and computation costs

Implementation Constraints:
- Practical system limitations:
  * Finite block lengths creating statistical vulnerabilities
  * Real-time requirements imposing latency constraints
  * Computation and memory limitations at both endpoints
  * Power constraints in mobile and embedded systems
  * Variable channel conditions requiring adaptive approaches
  * Multi-user scenarios with competing resource requirements

Optimization Approaches:
- JSCC system design:
  * Redundancy distribution across both source and channel coding
  * Error concealment techniques to recover from partial information loss
  * Cross-layer design integrating multiple protocol layers
  * Adaptation to changing network conditions
  * Computational load balancing between transmitter and receiver

Performance Metrics:
- System evaluation framework:
  * End-to-end distortion (rather than separate source and channel metrics)
  * Power/energy consumption across entire processing chain
  * Latency and computational complexity
  * Robustness to channel variations
  * Implementation feasibility on target hardware
  * Adaptability to varying operating conditions

Theoretical Extensions:
- Advanced information theory:
  * Finite blocklength information theory addressing practical code limits
  * Rate-distortion theory with computational constraints
  * Joint source-channel coding theorems for specific scenarios
  * Cross-layer information theory considering protocol stack interactions
  * Bandwidth-computation tradeoff formalization through B/C energy equation
