Core Framework (April 2025):
- Interest-based attention regulation:
  * Executive function capability significantly modulated by task interest level
  * Tasks that are boring but demand close attention create perfect executive function storm
  * Minimal intrinsic reward (low dopamine response) yet high cognitive demand
  * Same executive systems needed to overcome motivation gap are those affected
  * Creates significant disparity between performance on engaging versus unengaging tasks
  * Hyperfocus on high-interest domains contrasts with struggle on low-interest ones
  * Not simply a matter of willpower but different neurological response patterns

Performance Variability Factors:
- Executive function modulators:
  * Interest level (primary factor - determines baseline capability)
  * Sleep quality (affects available executive resources)
  * Stress level (consumes working memory bandwidth)
  * Social context (external scaffolding can supplement internal regulation)
  * Concurrent demands (limited resource allocatable across multiple tasks)
  * Task structure (external organization reduces executive demands)
  * Medication status (affects baseline neurotransmitter availability)

Resource Management Dynamics:
- Cognitive load implications:
  * "Attention spoons" concept applies - limited executive resources
  * High-vigilance tasks (like driving) deplete available resources
  * Negative anticipation of dreaded tasks itself consumes executive function
  * "Procrastination dysfunction" more accurate than moral judgment
  * Traditional productivity advice assumes consistent executive capabilities
  * Resource conservation leads to prioritizing inherently engaging tasks
  * Creates vicious cycle where uninteresting tasks generate increasing resistance

Strategy Adaptation Requirements:
- Working with instead of against the pattern:
  * Restructure boring tasks to incorporate interest elements
  * Break down low-interest tasks into smaller chunks
  * Use body-doubling to provide external structure
  * Create external scaffolding for initiation and transitions
  * Self-bribery effective for short-term but limited as extended practice
  * Match high-energy periods with low-interest tasks
  * Leverage strengths by applying high-interest skills to uninteresting domains

Self-Application Framework:
- Personal pattern recognition:
  * Software development enables flow states that bypass executive demands
  * Driving consumes significant attention resources (~15 hours/week)
  * Self-bribery sometimes effective but not sustainable
  * "Dragging around negative anticipation" creates mental overhead
  * Executive function challenges most pronounced with boring + attention-demanding tasks
  * Recognized potential relationship to ADHD profile (family pattern observed)
  * Metacognitive awareness enables development of compensatory strategies
