Core Insight:
Knowledge acquisition in ML/AI systems can be modeled as an entropy-reduction process analogous to Maxwell's demon. Validating and assimilating new knowledge requires computational work to assess truth, value, consistency, etc.

This effort is the cognitive analogue to Maxwell's demon sorting molecules. And just as the 2nd Law prevents any net reduction in thermodynamic entropy, it likely also constrains how much an information processing system can reduce its "knowledge entropy".  

Implications:
- Fundamental limit to the open-ended advancement of machine knowledge
- At some point, the cost to validate insights exceeds gains from uncertainty reduction
- Inherently asymptotic trajectory for AI capabilities as energetic cost grows non-linearly
