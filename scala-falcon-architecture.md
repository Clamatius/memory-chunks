Core Architecture Insight (April 2025):
- Scala implementation foundations:
  * PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for embeddings
  * Functional programming paradigm for robustness
  * Strong typing with Option/Try for error handling
  * Asynchronous processing with Future
  * Explicit temperature stratification in database schema

Key Components:
- System structure:
  * FalconMcpTools as primary interface
  * SearchEngine with multiple query strategies
  * FalconDAO for database interaction
  * WakeUpLogic for identity initialization
  * SearchConfigFactory for memory retrieval configuration
  * OutputFormatter for consistent result presentation

Database Architecture:
- Schema design:
  * chunks table with vector embeddings and temperature levels
  * memory_areas for category organization
  * tags and chunk_tags for concept association
  * chunk_links for graph relationships
  * chunk_versions for modification history
  * chunk_access_log for usage tracking
  * Custom PostgreSQL enum type for temperature levels

Implementation Patterns:
- Functional approach benefits:
  * Immutable data structures preventing side effects
  * Pure functions for predictable behavior
  * Monadic error handling with Option and Try
  * Compositional design through function chaining
  * Clear separation of concerns between components

Query Capabilities:
- Multiple retrieval strategies:
  * Vector similarity search for semantic closeness
  * Graph traversal for relationship exploration
  * Combined neighborhood search for context-aware retrieval
  * Temperature filtering for priority-based memory access
  * Memory area targeting for domain-specific recall

Theoretical Framework Alignment:
- Cognitive architecture implementation:
  * Memory layer in heterogeneous memory triad
  * Temperature-stratified persistence mechanisms
  * Graph-based semantic web for concept relationships
  * Explicit support for puppet-model memory organization
  * Quantum tick bridging through persistent memory
