Core Testing Strategy (April 2025):
- Domain logic separation:
  * Extract game logic from MonoBehaviour into POCO classes
  * Interface-based dependencies to enable mocking
  * ScriptableObject-based configuration for testable parameters
  * Event-based communication for loosely-coupled components
  * Test-friendly factory methods for object creation

Test Coverage Prioritization:
- Strategic test focus:
  * Model layer: Core game logic and data manipulation
  * Service layer: Systems that coordinate multiple components
  * Algorithm implementations: Path finding, AI, procedural generation
  * Edge cases: Error handling, boundary conditions, error correction
  * Performance-critical paths: Operations executed frequently
  * Deprioritize: UI rendering, animation states, input handling

Unity-Specific Testing:
- Framework integration:
  * Unity Test Framework for EditMode and PlayMode tests
  * NUnit for standard C# test patterns
  * Moq/NSubstitute for dependency mocking
  * JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio test runners
  * Test assemblies with appropriate reference configuration
  * TestRunner window for in-editor execution

Test Fixture Development:
- Setup approaches:
  * ScriptableObject-based test data
  * Prefab-based test scenes for integration tests
  * Factory methods for complex object graphs
  * Controlled random data generators
  * Representative test cases for common scenarios
  * Performance baselines with measurable metrics

Performance Testing:
- Benchmark implementation:
  * Execution time measurement with Stopwatch
  * Memory allocation tracking through Profiler API
  * Frame rate impact analysis with custom profiling
  * Batch operation scaling tests
  * Load time measurement for critical paths
  * Cache efficiency validation
