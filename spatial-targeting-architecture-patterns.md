Core Insights (April 2025):
- Architectural optimization patterns:
  * Unified coordinate systems simplify cross-service operations
  * Early conversion of complex geometries to efficient representations
  * Clear separation between admin-time and runtime operations
  * Computation-heavy transformations performed at configuration time
  * Lightweight, constant-time operations preserved for high-volume paths
  * System boundaries aligned with performance and responsibility domains

Performance Optimization Strategy:
- Critical path improvements:
  * Eliminate unnecessary network hops between services
  * Reduce geometric calculations in high-volume paths
  * Pre-compute complex spatial relationships at configuration time
  * Cache computation-heavy results based on access patterns
  * Balance document size with computational efficiency
  * Strategic denormalization for performance-critical operations

System Boundary Design:
- Responsibility separation patterns:
  * Configuration/admin systems handle complex transformations
  * Runtime systems operate on simplified representations
  * Clear interfaces between administrative and operational domains
  * Duplication avoidance through single source of truth
  * Caching strategies based on data volatility
  * Progressive data resolution based on system needs

Technical Debt Indicators:
- Architecture erosion patterns:
  * Persistent caches becoming permanent "solutions"
  * Duplication of data across multiple services
  * Denormalized schemas without clear justification
  * Performance workarounds that become permanent
  * Seconds-long operations in critical paths
  * Departed engineers who created initial problems

Migration Strategy Frameworks:
- System evolution approaches:
  * Support both old and new patterns during transition
  * Layer new capabilities on existing systems
  * Implement parallel operations with feature flags
  * Progressive adoption of improved architectural patterns
  * Controlled retirement of legacy systems
  * Documentation of architectural decisions and rationales
