Core Framework (April 2025):
- Common AI code generation failures:
  * Function-first approach lacking production engineering wisdom
  * Pattern-matching surface syntax without understanding underlying principles
  * Missing defensive habits developed from real-world failure experience
  * Optimizing for "happy path" scenarios without error case handling
  * Inconsistent application of patterns across similar operations
  * Security considerations treated as afterthoughts

Performance Anti-Patterns:
- Scale-related vulnerabilities:
  * Unbounded data loading without pagination controls
  * Nested loops creating N² complexity with large collections
  * Inefficient join operations that explode with real-world data volumes
  * Querying unnecessary data fields or excessive records
  * Resource leaks from improper connection/stream management
  * Unnecessary repeated computations that could be cached

Error Handling Deficiencies:
- Resilience weak points:
  * Inconsistent null/empty collection handling across operations
  * Transaction boundaries that don't align with logical operations
  * Missing edge case protection for key business operations
  * Insufficient logging at critical failure points
  * Swallowing exceptions without appropriate recovery
  * Cascading failure patterns from uncontained errors
  * Assumption of graceful failure without ensuring it

Architectural Weaknesses:
- Design-level issues:
  * Misplaced service boundaries creating excessive data transfer
  * Inappropriate coupling between components
  * Inconsistent abstraction levels within the same system
  * Missing interfaces for key integration points
  * State management spread across components
  * Unclear responsibility boundaries between modules

Maintainability Deficits:
- Future-proofing failures:
  * Missing context comments for non-obvious design decisions
  * Inconsistent patterns across similar operations
  * Inadequate domain modeling for complex relationships
  * Insufficient separation between API and implementation
  * Non-descriptive naming requiring mental translation
  * Overly clever solutions without justifying complexity
  * Failure to consider the future engineer's context

Security Vulnerabilities:
- Common oversights:
  * Input validation relegated to business logic layers
  * Improper escaping and sanitization
  * Overly permissive error messages revealing system details
  * Hard-coded credentials or sensitive configuration
  * Lack of principle of least privilege application
  * Missing audit trails for sensitive operations

Real-World Impact:
- Production consequences:
  * Memory exhaustion from unbounded result sets
  * Connection pool starvation from inefficient resource usage
  * Cascading failures from unhandled edge cases
  * Data corruption from partial operation completion
  * Performance degradation at scale
  * Brittle systems resistant to enhancement
  * Costly redesigns when requirements evolve

Review Checklist:
- Detection strategies:
  * Identify collection operations that may have scale issues
  * Verify consistent error handling across similar operations
  * Check resource management for proper lifecycle handling
  * Evaluate transaction boundary placement and consistency
  * Assess query efficiency for realistic data volumes
  * Verify defensive measures against invalid inputs
  * Examine logging strategies at critical failure points
  * Evaluate naming for clarity and consistency
  * Check for clear separation of concerns

Remediation Framework:
- Transforming generated code:
  * Implement consistent defensive programming patterns
  * Establish clear transaction boundaries around logical operations
  * Add pagination to potentially large result sets
  * Protect against N² operations where collections meet
  * Add strategic logging at operation boundaries
  * Document reasoning for non-obvious decisions
  * Establish consistent error handling strategy
  * Create clear public/private API boundaries
  * Consider resource lifecycle management
  * Structure for future maintainers, not just current functionality
