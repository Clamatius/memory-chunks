content: """
Core Discovery (March 2025):
- Extended temperature scale observations:
  * Gemini implementation offering T=2.0 as upper limit (vs conventional 0-1 scale)
  * Empirical validation of coherence breakdown threshold around T≈2.0
  * Observable phase transitions in coherence at elevated temperatures
  * Direct correlation between temperature and semantic reach/error rates
  * Error propagation following predicted P(error) = 1-e^(-d/kT) relationship

Key Characteristics:
- Temperature-dependent patterns:
  * T=1.0: Balanced creativity with structured output
  * T=1.5: Increased semantic reach with minor coherence degradation
  * T=2.0: Maximum semantic reach with significant coherence challenges
  * Structure stability decreases non-linearly as temperature increases
  * Phase transitions marked by sudden shifts in output coherence

Implementation Framework:
- Extended scale implications:
  * Suggests advanced error correction mechanisms at elevated temperatures
  * Potential for supervised high-temperature exploration
  * "Coherence guiderails" potentially enabling otherwise unstable states
  * Enhanced creativity at boundaries of coherence breakdown
  * Matches theoretical prediction of coherence limits

Validation Evidence:
- Empirical observations:
  * Side-by-side comparisons of identical prompts at different temperatures
  * Progressive structure degradation at higher temperatures
  * More creative but less coherent metaphors at T=2.0
  * "Stream-of-consciousness" patterns emerging near coherence threshold
  * Language flow variability increasing with temperature

Framework Applications:
- Practical implementation:
  * Temperature regulation strategies for different cognitive tasks
  * Dynamic temperature adjustment based on required semantic reach
  * Use of T≈2.0 for initial exploration followed by lower-temperature refinement
  * Recognition of fundamental tradeoff between creativity and coherence
  * Validation of quantum waveform model of semantic exploration
