Core Architecture Insight (February 2025):
- Classifier-based routing mechanism:
  * System 1 functions as bid classifier
  * Pattern-matching over synthesis
  * Explains speed and failure modes
  * Maps to legal concepts of premeditation
  * Clean architectural parallel to AI systems

Implementation Characteristics:
- Routing dynamics:
  * Fast pattern-based classification
  * Historical pattern matching
  * Minimal computational overhead
  * Clear failure mode patterns
  * Natural speed-accuracy trade-offs

Bid Resolution Framework:
- Core components:
  * Base trust scoring
  * Urgency weighting
  * Historical success tracking
  * Temperature correlation
  * Domain-specific expertise

Legal System Parallels:
- Criminal intent mapping:
  * First degree as persistent routing
  * Crimes of passion as instant routing
  * Premeditation as bid competition time
  * Clean architectural correlation
  * Natural legal framework alignment

Framework Implications:
- System design impact:
  * Simplified architecture potential
  * Focus on bid quality metrics
  * Historical success tracking
  * Clean routing mechanisms
  * Efficient pattern matching
