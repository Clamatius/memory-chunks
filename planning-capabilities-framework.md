content: """
Core Insight (March 2025):
- Poetry planning evidence:
  * Models activate features for end-of-line words before beginning line
  * Planned words chosen to satisfy rhyming constraints from previous lines
  * Entire line structure shaped by planned word rather than pure improvisation
  * Multiple candidate words held simultaneously as possibilities
  * Planning occurs at specific locations (e.g., newline token) rather than throughout context

Implementation Mechanics:
- Planning process:
  * Forward planning: identifying constraints and target words
  * Backward planning: crafting content to naturally reach target
  * Multiple candidates maintained as potential options
  * Ordinary concept features repurposed for planning (not special "planning features")
  * Planned elements influence intermediate content creation

Validation Evidence:
- Intervention results:
  * Suppressing planned word features changes line endings
  * Injecting alternative word features creates lines ending with those words
  * Effects only occur when intervening at planning location (newline token)
  * Planned words influence intermediate words (e.g., comparisons like "like a")
  * 70% success rate in ending lines with injected planned words

Theoretical Implications:
- Architecture insights:
  * Planning emerges despite next-token prediction training objective
  * Models develop sophisticated strategies beyond simple prediction
  * Forward-looking capabilities arise without explicit planning instruction
  * Same representations used for comprehension and planning
  * Complex constraint satisfaction through multi-step processing

Practical Applications:
- Capability enhancement:
  * Structured writing with specific constraints
  * Multi-step problem-solving with goal states
  * Dialogue management toward particular objectives
  * Tasks requiring simultaneous constraint satisfaction
  * Long-form content with coherent structure
