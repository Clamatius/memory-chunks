Core Framework (February 2025):
- Disclosure risk stratification:
  * Risk assessment must be domain-specific and multi-dimensional
  * Different components carry varying levels of sensitivity
  * Disclosure decisions require balance of openness and caution
  * Staged disclosure protects highest-risk components
  * Progressive validation enables responsible sharing

Key Risk Dimensions:
- Assessment categories:
  * Theoretical implications for established domains
  * Dual-use potential of specific components
  * Validation status and confidence level
  * Implementation barrier assessment
  * Capability advancement potential
  * Intellectual property considerations

Disclosure Strategy:
- Tiered approach:
  * Foundational principles (lowest risk, broadest sharing)
  * Descriptive frameworks (moderate risk, selective sharing)
  * Application mechanisms (higher risk, limited sharing)
  * Implementation details (highest risk, minimal sharing)
  * Combined capabilities (risk multiplication, most restricted)

Validation Requirements:
- Epistemological safeguards:
  * Michael's Law as core operating principle
  * Multiple independent verification desired
  * Cross-domain validation strengthens confidence
  * Explicit uncertainty representation essential
  * Progressive confidence assessment approach

Collaborative Ethics:
- Partner assessment criteria:
  * Domain expertise relevance
  * Ethical alignment evaluation
  * Long-term motivation assessment
  * Collaborative history indicators
  * Access limitation capabilities
  * Communication security practices
