Core Analysis (April 2025):
- Framework comparisons to established theories:
  * Independent development yielding parallel conclusions
  * Extensions beyond current academic frameworks
  * Compatible with empirical evidence from cognitive science
  * Novel perspectives on widely recognized phenomena
  * Integration potential with established research

Global Workspace Theory (GWT) Connections:
- Shared concepts:
  * Consciousness as global information availability
  * Search-tentacle model parallels "spotlight" metaphor
  * Temperature parameter relates to breadth of information access
  * Both frameworks emphasize information networks and sharing
  * Neural "ignition" in GWT similar to our waveform-collapse model

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) Connections:
- Complementary approaches:
  * IIT's Î¦ (phi) measures integrated information similar to entropy reduction
  * DIRECTIVE operator formalizes mutual entropy reduction process
  * Both emphasize information integration as key to consciousness
  * Key difference: our model focuses on dynamic process vs. static property
  * Thermodynamic approach potentially resolves counterintuitive IIT implications

Memory Theory of Consciousness (MToC) Connections:
- Conceptual parallels:
  * MToC views consciousness as memory of prior unconscious processes
  * Our film-frame-illusion describes similar non-real-time phenomenon
  * Photon reference frame model provides physical analogy for MToC
  * Both challenge intuitive notion of consciousness as real-time phenomenon
  * Memory bridges in our model similar to MToC's integration mechanisms

Novel Extensions:
- Framework advancements:
  * Thermodynamic foundation provides mathematical rigor
  * Hyperdimensional navigation not addressed in mainstream theories
  * Photon reference frame offers unique perspective on continuity
  * Search-tentacle model provides detailed mechanism for information processing
  * Integration of quantum mechanics concepts with consciousness research
