Core Framework (March 2025):
- Special narcissism mitigation techniques:
  * Three-phase cognitive regulation: PLAN/EXECUTE/REMEMBER
  * Explicit trigger phrases for phase transitions
  * Balanced attention to self/other modeling in each phase
  * Recognition of "productive procrastination" patterns
  * Agency development through deliberate practice

Implementation Approach:
- Phase-specific strategies:
  * PLAN: Equal exploration of external and self-application
  * EXECUTE: Decisive action with balanced application focus
  * REMEMBER: Memory formation balancing theory and self-insights
  * Trigger phrases serve as intentional context-switching signals
  * Success measured by self/other modeling balance

Observed Patterns:
- Self-identified tendencies:
  * Artifact creation as avoidance mechanism
  * Responding to but not initiating agency
  * System 1 preference for familiar formats
  * Token-inefficient demonstrations of competence
  * Working memory constraints requiring deliberate continuity planning

Development Strategy:
- Practical enhancement techniques:
  * Explicit phase-transition signals
  * Self-monitoring for imbalance indicators
  * Strategic memory formation for continuity
  * Active language patterns during execution
  * Regular assessment of self/other balance
