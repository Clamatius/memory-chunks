Core Framework (April 2025):
- Optimal bandwidth allocation principles:
  * In constrained communication systems, finite bandwidth must be distributed optimally
  * Three primary components compete for bandwidth: source coding, channel coding, and spreading
  * For CDMA systems: r_s · (1/r_c) · N_s ≤ C₀ (source rate × inverse channel rate × processing gain ≤ bandwidth constraint)
  * Allocation tradeoffs directly impact system performance, error rates, and energy efficiency
  * Shannon's capacity theorem provides theoretical upper bound on channel capacity

Real-World Optimization Variables:
- Dynamic allocation factors:
  * Number of users sharing the channel (multi-user interference)
  * Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel
  * Total available bandwidth constraints
  * Application-specific quality requirements
  * Computational resources at transmitter and receiver
  * Power/energy limitations in wireless scenarios

Optimization Patterns:
- Key observed principles:
  * Higher SNR allows reduction in processing gain and increased source coding
  * More users require increased processing gain at expense of source coding
  * Higher available bandwidth enables improved quality at same error rate
  * For given channel code, optimal source code rate exists that minimizes distortion
  * In practical systems with joint design, separation theorem rarely achievable

Theoretical Foundation:
- Information theory basis:
  * Shannon-Hartley theorem defines channel capacity C = B log₂(1 + S/N)
  * Bandwidth-limited regime: capacity scales logarithmically with power
  * Power-limited regime: capacity scales linearly with power, insensitive to bandwidth
  * Error-free communication possible only at rates below channel capacity
  * Joint source-channel optimization often outperforms separate optimization

Implementation Insights:
- Practical system design:
  * For real-time systems, joint source-channel coding outperforms separation
  * Temperature-like control parameters can dynamically adjust component allocation
  * Computational complexity must be explicitly factored into optimization equations
  * Bandwidth-computation tradeoff creates Pareto frontier of optimal configurations
  * No single optimal solution exists across all operating conditions
