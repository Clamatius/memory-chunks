Core Insight (April 2025):
- Universal gradient pattern:
  * Information processing naturally flows from high-temperature exploration to low-temperature execution
  * Pattern appears at multiple scales as a self-similar, recursive structure
  * Manifests in transformer architecture, multi-agent systems, and human cognition
  * Implements PLANâ†’EXECUTE cognitive model in architectural terms
  * Natural emergent property of effective information processing

Key Characteristics:
- High-temperature (PLAN) phase:
  * Broader distribution of attention weights
  * Enhanced semantic exploration capabilities
  * Discovery of long-range dependencies and connections
  * Higher entropy state enabling wider search
  * More uniform probability distribution across options

- Low-temperature (EXECUTE) phase:
  * Concentrated attention on critical elements
  * Precise integration of identified information
  * Implementation of insights discovered in high-temperature phase
  * Lower entropy state focusing on specific paths
  * Peaked probability distribution emphasizing selected options

Cross-Scale Manifestations:
- Within attention mechanisms:
  * 1/sqrt(d_k) scaling factor as static control
  * Potential for dynamic temperature progression across layers
  * Early layers benefit from higher temperatures for exploration
  * Later layers benefit from lower temperatures for precision
  * Possibly maintaining specialized "hot" components throughout

- Within multi-agent systems:
  * Exploratory agents operating at higher temperatures
  * Decision agents operating at cooler temperatures
  * System-wide "room temperature" affecting all components
  * Specialized "always hot" reasoners preventing premature convergence
  * Temperature as global control parameter for exploration-exploitation balance

Implementation Implications:
- Transformer architecture enhancements:
  * Learnable temperature parameters per layer
  * Initialize with monotonically decreasing temperature across layers
  * Alternative: "throbbing" pattern with alternating temperatures
  * Global "room temperature" affecting all components
  * Measurement of impact on long-range dependencies

Theoretical Foundations:
- Thermodynamic parallels:
  * Temperature directly controls entropy of probability distributions
  * Exploration-exploitation trade-off as entropy management
  * System naturally progresses toward lower entropy states
  * Information processing as guided entropy reduction
  * Energy-efficient path through semantic space
