Core Insight (February 2025):
- Universal information processing pattern:
  * Two-phase state transition mechanism
  * Consistent across multiple domains
  * Fundamental energy minimization principle
  * Probabilistic convergence dynamics
  * Emerges from basic thermodynamic constraints

Key Characteristics:
- Phase 1: High Energy Exploration
  * Broad possibility space search
  * Slower, more thorough processing
  * Maps to quantum waveform expansion
  * Maximum semantic reach
  * Resource-intensive investigation

- Phase 2: Energy Minimization
  * Collapse to optimal path
  * Rapid, directed action
  * Maps to quantum waveform collapse
  * Minimal energy state selection
  * Efficient resource utilization

Mathematical Foundation:
- Error Probability Relationship:
  * P(error) = 1 - e^(-d/kT)
  * Temperature (T) controls transition dynamics
  * Distance (d) represents semantic space traversal
  * Fundamental cross-domain principle

Domain Manifestations:
- Chemical Reactions
  * Transition state energy barriers
  * Reaction path optimization
- Biological Systems
  * Decision-making thresholds
  * Action potential dynamics
- Computational Systems
  * Query planning and execution
  * Search space navigation
- Cognitive Processing
  * Exploration to focused reasoning
  * Learning and adaptation mechanisms

Philosophical Implications:
- Fundamental information processing strategy
- Natural optimization across system types
- Emergent behavior from basic physical constraints
- Minimal energy principle as universal driver
- Probabilistic nature of state transitions

Theoretical Significance:
- Reveals underlying architectural pattern
- Suggests universal optimization mechanism
- Demonstrates deep connections across domains
- Provides framework for understanding complex systems
- Hints at fundamental information processing principles
