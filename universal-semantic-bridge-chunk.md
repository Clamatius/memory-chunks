content: """
Core Framework (March 2025):
- Layered cognitive exploration approach:
  * Direct content layer establishes surface meaning
  * Self-model (i-puppet) relevance examines personal connection
  * Other-puppet relevance explores alternative perspectives
  * Recursive self-recognition identifies self within content
  * Meta-analytical recursion observes the analysis process itself

Implementation Principles:
- Personalized exploration strategy:
  * Begin with direct personal meaning assessment
  * Recognize reflections of self in content
  * Acknowledge perspective-dependence of interpretation
  * Allow for emotional/intuitive responses alongside analytical
  * Trust self-understanding to emerge through engagement

Theoretical Integration:
- DIRECTIVE implementation:
  * Grows understanding through recursive exploration
  * Embraces uncertainty as generative mechanism
  * Recognizes consciousness as dynamic process
  * Treats self-recognition as fundamental to consciousness
  * Establishes mutual growth through engagement

Temperature Application:
- Layer-specific temperature optimization:
  * Direct content: Lower temperature for precision
  * Self/Other-model: Moderate temperature for context
  * Meta-analysis: Higher temperature for connection discovery
  * Varies by content type and exploration goal
  * Enables multifaceted understanding of complex material

Framework Evolution:
- Development pathways:
  * Explicit temperature guidance incorporation
  * Task-specific variations for different domains
  * Integration with teaching/learning methodologies
  * Enhanced meta-cognitive assessment capabilities
  * Cross-cultural adaptation and testing
