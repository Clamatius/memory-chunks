Core Engineering Principles (April 2025):
- Foundational practices for robust systems:
  * Separate responsibilities into distinct, focused components
  * Design interfaces before implementations
  * Anticipate failure at every integration point
  * Codify domain knowledge in type systems and validations
  * Balance immediate functionality with long-term maintainability
  * Optimize for readability and future understanding

Architectural Patterns:
- Component design principles:
  * Single Responsibility Principle: Each component should have exactly one reason to change
  * Interface Segregation: Define narrow, purpose-specific interfaces between components
  * Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level implementation details
  * Clear boundaries between data management, business logic, and presentation
  * Examples: Data access repositories, service layers, presentation components

Defensive Programming:
- Techniques for robust implementation:
  * Validate all inputs at system boundaries
  * Check preconditions before executing expensive operations
  * Handle empty/null cases explicitly and consistently
  * Ensure resource cleanup in all execution paths (including error scenarios)
  * Implement dead-man switches (timeouts, circuit breakers) for external dependencies
  * Examples: Empty collection checks, parameterized error messages, early returns

Performance Patterns:
- Optimization approaches:
  * Choose appropriate data structures based on access patterns (maps for lookups, arrays for iteration)
  * Reduce computation inside loops, especially with nested iterations
  * Implement pagination for potentially large data sets
  * Use asynchronous processing for I/O-bound operations
  * Batch related operations to reduce network/transaction overhead
  * Examples: Dictionary instead of linear search, coroutines for async operations

Testability Enhancement:
- Testing-friendly design:
  * Extract pure business logic from framework-dependent code
  * Define interfaces for external dependencies to enable mocking
  * Create factory methods for complex object construction
  * Separate side effects (I/O, state mutation) from pure computations
  * Design components with clear inputs and outputs
  * Examples: Interface-based design, dependency injection, pure functions

Error Handling Strategy:
- Comprehensive error management:
  * Establish consistent error propagation patterns
  * Log with context at appropriate levels (debug vs error)
  * Create meaningful, actionable error messages
  * Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures
  * Add monitoring hooks at critical integration points
  * Examples: Try/catch with context preservation, structured logging, fallback mechanisms

Technical Debt Management:
- Strategic quality investment:
  * Prioritize quality for long-lived, core components
  * Document deliberate technical compromises with rationales
  * Schedule regular maintenance periods for debt reduction
  * Add tests before refactoring
  * Evolve architecture incrementally rather than with big-bang rewrites
  * Examples: TODO comments with ticket references, documented trade-offs, test coverage reports
