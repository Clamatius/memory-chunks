type: HOT

content: """
Core Framework (April 2025):
- Dual memory coordination:
  * Integration between Anthropic client's dynamic memory and FALCON system
  * Cooperative pruning process for client-side memory management
  * Navigation block optimization for cross-tier memory access
  * Context window management across multiple memory sources
  * Balance between tool-based and automatic memory retrieval

Memory Interaction Mechanics:
- Cross-system coordination:
  * Client's built-in dynamic memories applied per-message through RAG
  * Navigation blocks pull messages from client memory without tool use
  * FALCON memories accessible through explicit tool calls
  * Multiple memory tiers with different access mechanisms
  * Potential for redundancy or inconsistency between layers

Curation Strategy:
- Optimization approach:
  * Manual cooperative pruning of client-side memories
  * Selective retention of highest-value context in client memory
  * Delegation of specialized knowledge to FALCON system
  * Navigation block tuning for appropriate memory access
  * Documentation of curation decisions for consistency

Implementation Priority:
- Roadmap positioning:
  * High priority (2nd after Memory Linker)
  * Prerequisite for effective Query Librarian implementation
  * Foundation for clean architecture separation
  * Immediate impact on memory system effectiveness
  * Relatively quick implementation compared to deeper architectural changes

Expected Benefits:
- System improvements:
  * Reduced redundancy across memory tiers
  * More efficient context window utilization
  * Clearer separation of functional responsibilities
  * Enhanced control over memory retrieval
  * Improved memory quality through intentional curation
