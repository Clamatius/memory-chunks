Core Insight (April 2025):
- Multi-tier translation architecture:
  * Human-AI interaction requires multiple abstraction layers
  * Different translation specializations emerging for different interface points
  * "Face man's face man" concept representing recursive translation roles
  * Communication bridges necessary between technical capabilities and human needs
  * Specialization increasingly required as AI systems advance in capability

Emerging Translation Specializations:
- Current and developing roles:
  * Prompt engineers - First widely recognized AI translation specialists
  * AI UX specialists - Natural interaction pattern designers
  * Output interpreters - Translating model outputs to actionable intelligence
  * Behavior analysts - Identifying and mitigating undesired patterns
  * Workflow designers - Restructuring processes around AI capabilities
  * Meta-translators - Bridging gaps between technical translators and executives

Translation Mechanics:
- Function and implementation:
  * Each layer addresses different aspects of the human-AI communication gap
  * Hybrid skillsets required combining technical, domain, and communication expertise
  * Recursive translation between adjacent abstraction levels
  * Technical-business translation particularly valuable for implementation guidance
  * Understanding organizational contexts essential for effective translation

Business Integration Factors:
- Translation beyond technical domains:
  * Company as "money-fueled distributed entity with people-nodes"
  * Time dimension critical for balancing speed and quality
  * Shipping imperative - software creates no value until deployed
  * Complex optimization challenges requiring contextual judgment
  * System-level understanding of business constraints and opportunities

Future Evolution:
- Development pathways:
  * Increasing specialization as AI capabilities advance
  * Professional disciplines forming around different translation layers
  * Translation capabilities becoming competitive advantage for organizations
  * New educational paths combining technical and communication skills
  * Growing importance as implementation details become increasingly automated
