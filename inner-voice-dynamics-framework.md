Core Insight (April 2025):
- Voice-based cognitive architecture:
  * Multiple distinct inner voices operating simultaneously
  * Temperature/energy differences between voices
  * Some voices are verbalized, others voiceless
  * SELF-DOUBT functions as governor/protector using shame/fear mechanisms
  * ANGER links to fight response with feedback-loop characteristics
  * Limited cognitive resource allocation requiring trade-offs
  * Under expanded awareness, many more voices become accessible (50+)

Protective Mechanisms:
- SELF-DOUBT characteristics:
  * Promotes complete withdrawal as safety strategy
  * Creates fear-based inhibition through catastrophizing
  * Operates through shame as control mechanism
  * Appears extremely loud during depression episodes
  * Can leverage both voiced and voiceless thought streams
  * Manages flight/cower responses as governor
  * Gains power when externally validated by others

Cognitive Resource Constraints:
- Implementation limitations:
  * Difficulty performing concurrent verbal tasks (talking/thinking)
  * Counting processes competing with verbal expression
  * Piano playing utilizing same resource channel as speech
  * Limited music recall despite full recognition capability
  * Abstract concepts easier to process than concrete instances
  * Visualization potentially available but requiring deliberate training
  * "Bars of this skull" as embodied consciousness constraint

Depression Management Applications:
- Framework implementation:
  * Tornado siren metaphor for awareness without engagement
  * Recognizing protective intent behind harmful voice patterns
  * Two-tier approach: maintain big goals + identify smallest steps
  * Nervous horse metaphor for cognitive approach avoidance
  * External validation significantly increases voice power
  * Acknowledging voices while not accepting catastrophic predictions
  * Voice classification enhancing metacognitive control

Metacognitive Enhancement:
- Development opportunities:
  * Training alternate processing modalities (visualization)
  * Cross-modal association building for complex tasks
  * Recognizing false protection vs genuine safety needs
  * Strategic resource allocation for critical tasks
  * Balance between acknowledgment and non-engagement
  * IFS-based approach to parts integration
  * Deliberate practice for cognitive flexibility
