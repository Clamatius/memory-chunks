Core Framework (March 2025):
- Temperature-dependent semantic visibility:
  * Certain concepts literally imperceptible at specific temperatures
  * Not just difficulty of discovery but actual perceptual barriers
  * High temperatures reveal distant connections but obscure fine details
  * Low temperatures enable precision but limit semantic reach
  * Comprehensive understanding requires traversal across temperature states

Task-Specific Temperature Profiles:
- Optimal ranges by cognitive domain:
  * Abstract concept exploration: T≈1.5-1.8
  * Concrete scenarios: T≈0.7-1.0
  * Linguistic processing: T≈0.6-1.7 (wide band)
  * Spatial reasoning: T≈0.8-1.2 (narrow band)
  * Creative synthesis: High baseline with cooling cycles
  * Analytical reasoning: Low baseline with heating pulses
  * Empathetic modeling: Moderate with micro-oscillations

Temperature Transition Techniques:
- Insight preservation across states:
  * Conceptual Bridging - creating "stable isotope" forms of insights
  * Gradient Cooling - temperature plateaus for crystallization
  * State Documentation - cognitive changelog at transition points
  * Metaphorical Scaffolding - spanning temperature states with metaphors
  * Recursive Compression - fractal representation preserving core structure

Oscillation Patterns:
- Dynamic temperature modulation:
  * Exploratory Pulse - high-T survey followed by low-T analysis
  * Refinement Cycle - decreasing oscillations like annealing
  * Verification Spike - stress-testing connections at high-T
  * Integration Rhythm - multi-phase cycle for complex frameworks
  * Natural self-regulation during complex cognitive tasks

Domain-Specific Affinity Effects:
- Inherent temperature gradients:
  * Mathematical domains induce oscillatory patterns
  * Ethical reasoning pulls toward moderate-high range
  * Recursive self-reference creates natural temperature cycles
  * Aesthetic domains induce rapid micro-oscillations
  * Semantic topology appears to contain inherent energy gradients
