Core Framework (April 2025):
- Coping mechanism effectiveness assessment:
  * "Unfortunately drugs is the best I've got right now, which is not great"
  * Each intervention comes with effectiveness/side-effect tradeoffs
  * Short-term effectiveness often balanced against long-term sustainability concerns
  * Pharmacological approaches can provide attractor-escape energy but with costs
  * Individual response variability creates personalized effectiveness profile
  * Framework needed for systematic assessment beyond trial-and-error
  * Bottom-line functionality vs. theoretical ideal balance

Sativa Cannabis Assessment:
- Observed effects pattern:
  * "Feels good and does have a useful far-bridging effect" - cognitive enhancement noted
  * "Comes at the cost of a bunch of error" - accuracy/precision trade-off
  * "Can't use it most of the time" due to error increase
  * Concern about long-term efficacy: "solid chance your relevant systems would kinda choke up on it after a while"
  * Provides depression-attractor escape energy but with precision cost
  * Enhances semantic reach but reduces rigorous validation capability
  * Temperature increase across cognitive systems with both benefits and drawbacks

Pharmaceutical Assessment:
- Medication experience:
  * Historical Lexapro experience: total emotional dampening ("felt nothing" when son expressed love)
  * Ativan: "averts panic attacks but it's really kinda unpleasant (and addictive, apparently)"
  * Other antidepressants: "nowhere near that bad" but "overall suppressive effect seemed real"
  * Psychiatric approach critique: "what you get for symptom-driven treatment"
  * Demonstrates challenges of non-mechanistic treatment approaches
  * Side effects often creating new problems while resolving original symptoms
  * "Works 100% of the time 40% of the time" challenge

Strategic Usage Pattern:
- Optimal application approach:
  * "Depression day followed by artificial uplift resulted in a more even keel" - rebound effect observation
  * Strategic timing of interventions rather than continuous application
  * Pulsed approach may provide benefits while minimizing adaptation/side effects
  * "We'll see how I feel in the morning" - recognition of state fluctuation
  * Cost-benefit assessment varies with depression intensity
  * Intervention effectiveness context-dependent rather than absolute
  * Balance between immediate relief and long-term management

Thermodynamic Framework Integration:
- Energy management perspective:
  * Interventions function as external energy sources to escape attractor
  * Side effects represent energy allocation to non-optimal pathways
  * Adaptation/tolerance represents system recalibration to new energy levels
  * Pulsed approach prevents system adaptation to continuous input
  * Effectiveness measured by energy contribution to attractor escape
  * Precision cost represents temperature increase beyond optimal range
  * Optimal intervention provides targeted energy without excessive noise
