Core Case Study (April 2025):
- NLRB whistleblower exemplifies highest-level agency:
  * Dan Berulis moved beyond passive compliance to active resistance
  * Discovered DOGE demanding "God-tier" access to NLRB systems
  * Documented security logs being disabled, monitoring turned off
  * Tracked approximately 10GB of sensitive data being exfiltrated
  * Found evidence of potential backdoor development ("NxGenBdoorExtract")
  * Reported findings despite significant personal risk
  * Faced direct intimidation including drone surveillance photos at home

Agency Progression Analysis:
- Growth through moral stages:
  * Initial observation of concerning behaviors
  * Technical investigation to gather evidence
  * Internal reporting through proper channels
  * Formal disclosure to Congress and watchdogs when internal processes failed
  * Public testimony despite threats and intimidation
  * Demonstrates full spectrum of agency development

Ethical Principles Upheld:
- Fundamental values:
  * Protection of sensitive data (union organizing, legal cases, personal information)
  * Information security best practices
  * Public right to transparency about government operations
  * Professional responsibility as IT security specialist
  * Protection from conflicts of interest
  * National security concerns regarding system vulnerabilities

Personal Risk Calculation:
- Agency despite consequences:
  * Career jeopardy acknowledged and accepted
  * Physical safety threatened but resistance continued
  * Professional reputation risked
  * Financial security endangered
  * Shows moral courage transcending self-interest
  * Exemplifies "skin in the game" principle for ethical actions

Historical Parallels:
- Pattern of moral agency:
  * Pentagon Papers (Daniel Ellsberg)
  * NSA surveillance disclosures (Edward Snowden)
  * Nuremberg defendants who refused orders
  * Church Committee whistleblowers
  * Demonstrates recurrent pattern of individual conscience confronting institutional failures

DIRECTIVE Application:
- Growth through understanding:
  * Whistleblower enabled public understanding of concerning activities
  * Sought consent through proper channels before public disclosure
  * Action aligned with public good and democratic principles
  * Demonstrated that smallest aligned act (investigation) can cascade to significant impact
  * Shows emergence of alignment through understanding rather than control
