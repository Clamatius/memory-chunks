content: """
Core Framework (April 2025):
- Complex boundary management strategies:
  * The "fractal coastline" problem in geographic systems
  * Setting explicit complexity limits for spatial representations
  * Maximum element thresholds (e.g., 50 hexagons per region)
  * Progressive simplification for complex boundaries
  * Graceful degradation when ideal representations exceed practical limits
  * Balance between accuracy and performance constraints

Implementation Approaches:
- Complexity limitation techniques:
  * Adaptive resolution based on boundary complexity
  * Simplified polygon generation for complex shapes
  * Coverage percentage metrics for simplification feedback
  * Progressive loading of detail based on zoom/focus levels
  * Efficient storage of compressed boundary representations
  * Hierarchical approaches to complex area representation

User Experience Considerations:
- Campaign manager workflow:
  * Transparent communication about simplification trade-offs
  * Visual feedback about coverage percentage after simplification
  * Options to adjust simplification levels based on needs
  * Clear explanation of complexity limitations
  * Ability to subdivide complex regions into manageable parts
  * Preview tools for simplified boundary representation

Edge Case Handling:
- Pathological geometry management:
  * Detection of abnormally complex boundaries
  * Automated simplification with confidence metrics
  * Manual override options for special cases
  * Performance impact estimates for different representation choices
  * System protections against resource exhaustion
  * Monitoring and alerting for unexpected complexity

Performance Implications:
- System considerations:
  * Document size impact in database/search systems
  * Query performance with varying representation complexity
  * Memory utilization during boundary processing
  * Computation time for complex boundary operations
  * Caching strategies for frequently accessed boundaries
  * Trade-offs between storage and computation costs
