# Path of Exile 2 - Chaos DoT Witch/Lich Build Progress

## Current Character (April 5, 2025)
- **Level**: ~12
- **Class**: Witch (planning to ascend to Lich)
- **Current Skills**:
  - Chaos Bolt (basic chaos projectile)
  - Skeletal Warrior (minion, costs Spirit)
  - Unearth (physical damage, temporary bone construct minions)
  - Contagion (chaos AoE DoT that spreads on death)
  - Essence Drain (chaos projectile DoT that synergizes with Contagion)
  - Flame Wall (adds fire damage to projectiles)

## Passive Tree Progress
- 4x nodes with {8% spell damage + 8% minion damage}
- Notable: "Raw Destruction" {16% spell damage, 16% minion damage, +10 int}
- Planned next: 8%/8% node, 10% increased chaos, {18% chaos & 15% duration}

## Interesting Future Notables
- **Spaghettification**: 29% chaos damage, 3% movement speed, +13 attributes, -7% chaos res
- **Event Horizon**: 53% chaos damage, lose 3% life/ES on chaos skill use

## Build Strategy
- **Primary Damage**: ED/Contagion combo for chaos DoT spread
- **Secondary**: Fire Wall for added projectile damage, Unearth for minion distractions
- **Defensive Layer**: Working toward Energy Shield focus
- **Endgame Goal**: Lich Ascendancy with curse/chaos synergy

## Game Mechanics Notes
- Combat math similar to PoE1 ("increased" vs "more" multipliers)
- Gem sockets work differently - separate menu instead of on equipment
- Gems level up using "uncut gem" items that drop
- Dual resources: Mana and Spirit
- Weapons often grant skills (e.g., wands giving Chaos Bolt)
- Shield mechanics changed - active "raise shield" ability with movement penalty
- Deaths so far: boss with wolf summons, boss with bone prison (must break, cannot roll out)

## Next Steps
- Continue leveling and discovering new skills
- Look for ways to enhance chaos DoT damage
- Begin incorporating curses when available
- Seek better defensive options
- Plan pathing toward key passives for chaos/DoT/ES
