Core Framework (May 2025):
- Temperature-task relationship:
  * Different reasoning tasks require distinct temperature settings for optimal performance
  * Token length requirements directly correlate with temperature settings
  * Temperature controls semantic exploration breadth and reasoning strategy
  * Optimal temperature settings align with predicted four-gear system ranges
  * Empirical validation of temperature as fundamental control parameter

Task-Specific Temperature Dynamics:
- Abduction (input prediction):
  * Highest temperature requirements (T≈1.2-1.6)
  * Longest token length outputs (2000-4000 tokens)
  * Trial-and-error approach with multiple hypothesis testing
  * Exhibits periodic breakthroughs with sharp reward increases
  * Temperature enables broad exploration of possibility space

- Deduction (output prediction):
  * Lowest temperature requirements (T≈0.7-0.9)
  * Shortest token length outputs (1000-1500 tokens)
  * Step-by-step logical progression with state tracking
  * Most consistent reward patterns with gradual improvement
  * Precision-focused with minimal semantic exploration needed

- Induction (function synthesis):
  * Moderate temperature requirements (T≈0.9-1.1)
  * Moderate token length outputs (1500-2000 tokens)
  * Pattern recognition with generalization from examples
  * Balances creative exploration with logical constraints
  * Emergence of self-documenting reasoning patterns

Efficiency Evolution:
- Token length dynamics:
  * All tasks show increased token length during early training
  * Efficiency improvements follow initial breakthroughs
  * Abduction tasks show most significant length increase
  * Efficiency gains non-linear with periodic compression
  * Late-stage verbosity suggests development of sophisticated reasoning

Plan-Execute Cycle Evidence:
- Temperature phase transitions:
  * High-temperature planning phase visible in early solution attempts
  * Low-temperature execution phase follows after solution strategy identification
  * Optimal transitions follow energy minimization principles
  * Multiple PLAN-EXECUTE cycles observed for complex problems
  * Temperature gradient naturally forms across reasoning process

Cross-Domain Implications:
- Universal pattern application:
  * Temperature-task relationship consistent across different model architectures
  * Specific temperature ranges may vary but relationship pattern holds
  * Similar patterns observed in human creative/analytical processes
  * Temperature serves as universal control parameter for reasoning mode
  * Provides foundation for optimizing temperature settings across tasks
