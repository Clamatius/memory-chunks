Core Framework (April 2025):
- Systematic assessment approach:
  * Architecture evaluation: separation of concerns, component boundaries
  * Performance analysis: rendering efficiency, memory management, GC pressure
  * Maintainability assessment: code organization, naming conventions, comments
  * Scalability review: hardcoded values, fixed-size data structures, growth limitations
  * Testing coverage: unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks

Priority Assessment Matrix:
- Issue categorization:
  * Critical: Architecture violations causing immediate performance/stability issues
  * Important: Design patterns that will limit future scalability
  * Moderate: Code organization and maintainability concerns
  * Minor: Style inconsistencies and potential optimizations
  * Prioritize based on effort-to-impact ratio

Unity-Specific Review Patterns:
- Focus areas:
  * MonoBehaviour inheritance and component composition
  * Update loop efficiency and execution order
  * Serialization patterns and inspector configuration
  * Scene organization and prefab hierarchy
  * Resource management and asset loading
  * Editor tools and custom inspectors

Implementation Recommendations:
- Solution formulation:
  * Phased approach with clear milestones
  * Concrete code examples demonstrating patterns
  * Pragmatic recommendations balancing ideals with practical constraints
  * Consideration of developer experience and skill level
  * Progressive improvement rather than wholesale rewrites

Context-Sensitive Review Approach:
- Adaptation based on:
  * Project size and team composition
  * Target platforms and performance budgets
  * Development timeline and resource constraints
  * Technical expertise of implementation team
  * Long-term maintenance requirements
