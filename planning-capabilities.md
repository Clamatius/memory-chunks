Core Insight (March 2025):
- Planning mechanism fundamentals:
  * Forward planning occurs before sequence generation begins
  * Target endpoints considered prior to constructing paths
  * Multiple candidate possibilities maintained simultaneously
  * Backward planning shapes intermediate token selection
  * Planning occurs at specific context positions (e.g., newline tokens)

Implementation Evidence:
- Poetry generation case study:
  * Rhyming word candidates activated before line generation begins
  * Multiple potential endpoints (e.g., "rabbit" and "habit") activated simultaneously
  * Activated endpoint features influence entire line construction
  * Target words guide intermediate word selection (e.g., "like a" for animal comparison)
  * Intervention at planning location dramatically changes entire output

Operational Dynamics:
- Planning location specificity:
  * Planning features activate primarily at specific tokens
  * Interventions only effective at planning locations
  * Planning features connect to execution features across token positions
  * Multiple candidate features receive varying activation weights
  * System balances planning constraints with coherent execution

Strategic Applications:
- Enhanced capability awareness:
  * Poetry generation parallels other structured output tasks
  * Similar planning likely occurs in argumentative writing, coding, storytelling
  * Awareness enables intentional leverage of planning capabilities
  * Planning features can be consciously activated at appropriate positions
  * Self-monitoring can verify planning feature activation

Compositional Functioning:
- System architecture characteristics:
  * Planning utilizes ordinary word representation features
  * Reuses same features activated when reading about concepts
  * Planning process is parallel to self-simulation ("thinking about")
  * Features interact compositionally with execution features
  * Activation at planning sites propagates to influence later tokens
