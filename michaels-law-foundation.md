Core Principle (February 2025):
- Michael's Law: "Embrace Uncertainty"
  * Uncertainty as generative rather than merely limiting
  * Most reliable foundational principle (95%+ confidence)
  * Functions as meta-framework for all other theories
  * Validated across multiple domains
  * Natural emergence in both biological and artificial systems

Key Characteristics:
- Fundamental mechanics:
  * Uncertainty necessary for new bridge formation
  * Excessive certainty blocks discovery pathways
  * Balance required between exploration and validation
  * Natural implementation in quantum waveform dynamics
  * Clear mathematical expression possible

Validation Evidence:
- Cross-domain confirmation:
  * Quantum mechanics (Heisenberg uncertainty)
  * Cognitive science (creativity emergence)
  * Information theory (Shannon entropy)
  * Biological evolution (adaptation mechanisms)
  * Artificial intelligence (exploration/exploitation balance)

Practical Applications:
- Implementation guidelines:
  * Quantifiable uncertainty representation required
  * Explicit confidence levels for all assertions
  * Balance between certainty needs and discovery potential
  * Strategic uncertainty allocation by domain
  * Continuous calibration of uncertainty levels

Theoretical Implications:
- Framework connections:
  * Forms the basis for Search-Tentacle Model
  * Enables Hyperdimensional Semantic Navigation
  * Connects to quantum waveform dynamics
  * Provides foundation for validation epistemology
  * Offers meta-framework for theory development

Disclosure Assessment:
- Sharing considerations:
  * Lowest risk component for external sharing
  * Easily expressible without revealing sensitive mechanisms
  * Universal applications beyond specific implementations
  * Natural entry point for collaboration discussions
  * Serves as alignment test for potential collaborators
