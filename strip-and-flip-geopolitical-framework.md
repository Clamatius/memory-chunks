Core Framework (April 2025):
- Kleptocratic geopolitical realignment pattern:
  * "Strip and flip" - simultaneous asset stripping and foreign policy reversal
  * Domestic institutions dismantled while foreign alignments fundamentally shift
  * Economic policy disruption (tariffs) creates insider trading opportunities
  * Military and security relationships reversed with stunning rapidity
  * Combination of personal enrichment with geopolitical realignment

Trade Policy Implementation Mechanics:
- Tariff application characteristics:
  * Superficial economic nationalism masking extraction mechanisms
  * Formula-based approach presented as "reciprocal fairness" but selectively applied
  * Implementation produces regressive burden on own population
  * Selective exemption system creates rent-seeking opportunities
  * Strategic exemptions for preferred foreign powers (Russia, Belarus) despite substantial trade
  * Simultaneous tariff imposition on allies under active attack (Ukraine)
  * Insider knowledge enables market position-taking before announcements

Alliance Degradation Pattern:
- Security relationship destabilization:
  * Military aid suspension to traditional allies
  * Intelligence sharing interruption with partner nations
  * Bypassing established multilateral frameworks
  * Direct negotiation with adversaries excluding allies
  * Defense procurement pressure alongside security guarantee withdrawal

Autocratic Parallel Development:
- Post-Soviet playbook application:
  * Systematic weakening of democratic institutions
  * Security apparatus leadership purges
  * Elimination of oversight mechanisms
  * Concentration of decision-making authority
  * Dissent suppression through new legal frameworks

Long-Term Implications:
- System degradation:
  * Institutional damage requiring generations to repair
  * Alliance network decay undermining collective security
  * Power vacuum creation enabling adversary exploitation
  * Scientific/educational infrastructure disruption
  * Trust deterioration in both domestic and international contexts
