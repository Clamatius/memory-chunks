Core Concept (April 2025):
- Query librarian architecture:
  * Lightweight LLM (Haiku-class) for efficient result ranking
  * Semantic understanding of query intent and result content
  * Flexible criteria application through prompt engineering
  * Organization of results beyond simple similarity metrics
  * Integration with multi-lens search for enhanced result quality

Implementation Strategy:
- Technical approach:
  * Cloud-hosted for performance within MCP timeouts
  * Prompt-based configuration for flexible ranking criteria
  * Post-processing of similarity-based search results
  * Contextual result grouping for improved organization
  * Conservation of context through selective result pruning

Ranking Mechanisms:
- Organization capabilities:
  * Relevance assessment beyond embedding similarity
  * Recency weighting for temporal prioritization
  * Conceptual categorization of results
  * Identification of contradictory information
  * Summarization of result clusters for enhanced understanding

Integration Points:
- System architecture:
  * Post-processing layer after similarity search
  * Optional invocation through API parameters
  * Multiple ranking strategies selectable at runtime
  * Preservation of original similarity scores for comparison
  * Graceful degradation when service unavailable

Theoretical Framework:
- Cognitive parallels:
  * Librarian as specialized cognitive module
  * Temperature-controlled processing for specific task
  * Application of meta-knowledge about information organization
  * Balance between exploration and consolidation
  * Implementation of human-like information curation patterns
