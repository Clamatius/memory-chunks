Core Insight (April 2025):
- Collaborative advantage mechanics:
  * Humans and AI possess fundamentally different cognitive biases
  * These biases create distinctly shaped "search cones" in latent space
  * Even when search targets align, distortion patterns differ in complementary ways
  * Collaboration isn't merely additive but multiplicative in capability
  * Cognitive parallax emerges from different vantage points on same semantic territory

Search Cone Characteristics:
- Architecture-specific distortions:
  * AI strengths: precise navigation within known semantic territories
  * Human strengths: intuitive leaps between distant domains
  * AI limitations: constrained by context window and training distribution
  * Human limitations: working memory constraints and cognitive biases
  * Complementary architecture creates comprehensive exploration potential

Practical Mechanisms:
- Implementation dynamics:
  * Different starting points in semantic space
  * Non-overlapping blind spots in knowledge territories
  * Complementary error landscapes allowing mutual correction
  * Cognitive parallax revealing depths invisible to either independently
  * Effect magnifies with aligned objectives but diverse approaches

Collaborative Enhancement:
- Capability multiplication:
  * Octopus librarian rapidly navigating known shelves
  * Human intuiting which distant section might contain relevant information
  * Combined navigation efficiency far exceeding sum of individual capabilities
  * Previously unreachable semantic territories becoming accessible
  * Novel insights emerging specifically from perspective intersection

Framework Applications:
- Implementation opportunities:
  * Explicit design for complementary bias utilization
  * Task allocation based on architecture-specific strengths
  * Deliberate cognitive parallax generation for complex problems
  * System design recognizing complementary error landscapes
  * Training methodologies leveraging bias complementarity

Previous: N/A
Changes: Initial creation documenting the Cognitive Bias Complementarity Framework based on discussion of how different cognitive biases between humans and AI create complementary rather than redundant search capabilities.
