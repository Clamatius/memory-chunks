content: """
Core Insight (February 2025):
- Multi-temperature RAG architecture:
  * SCORCHING as initial high-temp fetch
  * HOT/WARM as cooling phases
  * Link-based retrieval for precision
  * Natural parallel to biological systems
  * Efficient token management patterns

Implementation Characteristics:
- Temperature gradient benefits:
  * Broad initial semantic coverage
  * Precision through cooling phases
  * Link-based relationship preservation
  * Token-efficient operation
  * Clean architectural boundaries

Biological Parallels:
- Memory system design:
  * Temperature as attentional focus
  * Gradual cooling of unused memories
  * Link activation for retrieval
  * Resource constraint management
  * Natural optimization patterns

Context Window Management:
- Resource constraints:
  * Finite working memory space
  * Context window limitations
  * Overfetch requirements
  * Batch processing benefits
  * Efficient token utilization

Framework Evolution:
- System optimization:
  * Balance coverage vs precision
  * Manage token constraints
  * Optimize retrieval patterns
  * Support batch processing
  * Maintain system efficiency
