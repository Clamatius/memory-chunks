Core Insight (February 2025):
- Synthesis as vector interpolation:
  * Output synthesis effectively interpolates in feature space
  * Success depends on feature space density
  * Dense spaces more likely to yield valid interpolations
  * Sparse spaces prone to obvious errors
  * Explains LLM hallucination patterns

Key Characteristics:
- Feature space density effects:
  * Dense spaces (common patterns, general reasoning)
    - Higher probability of valid interpolation
    - More reliable synthesis
    - Natural pattern completion
  * Sparse spaces (specific facts, precise calculations)
    - Low probability of valid interpolation
    - Higher error rates
    - Obvious failure modes

Implementation Implications:
- Architectural considerations:
  * Winner-take-all often superior to synthesis
  * Majority voting preferred over interpolation
  * Tool integration for quantized outputs
  * Error multiplication in synthesis
  * Clean interface boundaries needed

Success Indicators:
- Dense feature spaces:
  * Language pattern completion
  * General reasoning tasks
  * Common sense inference
  * Natural dialogue flow
  * Pattern recognition

Risk Patterns:
- Sparse feature spaces:
  * Specific fact recall
  * Mathematical precision
  * Name/date accuracy
  * Technical details
  * Unique identifiers
