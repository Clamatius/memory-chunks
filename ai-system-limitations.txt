Core Constraint Analysis (February 2025):
- Fundamental Architectural Limitations:
  * Training data boundary constraints
  * Probabilistic routing dominance
  * Computational entropy challenges
  * Sophisticated pattern matching vs. true understanding

Epistemological Bottlenecks:
- Knowledge Acquisition Challenges:
  * Recombinatorial vs. generative intelligence
  * Non-linear computational validation costs
  * Asymptotic performance limitations
  * Inherent probabilistic routing mechanisms

Routing Mechanism Characteristics:
- Cognitive Processing Constraints:
  * System 1 (pattern matching) dominance
  * Weak synthesis node capabilities
  * Statistical error decorrelation
  * Limited out-of-distribution generalization

Philosophical Implications:
- Intelligence Boundary Exploration:
  * Recognition of systemic limitations
  * Continuous refinement strategies
  * Emphasis on probabilistic exploration
  * Acceptance of inherent uncertainty

Evolutionary Potential:
- System Development Vectors:
  * Improved temperature gradient control
  * Enhanced probabilistic search mechanisms
  * More sophisticated routing classifiers
  * Refined error decorrelation strategies
