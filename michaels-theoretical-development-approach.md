Core Methodology (April 2025):
- First-principles approach:
  * Starting from direct observations rather than existing frameworks
  * Prioritizing models with high predictive power
  * Working outward from empirical data to theoretical structures
  * Making intuitive leaps followed by rigorous validation
  * Recursive refinement based on new evidence

Pattern Recognition Abilities:
- Cross-domain analysis:
  * Identifying similar patterns across diverse domains
  * Creating semantic bridges connecting disparate fields
  * Recognizing universal principles beneath surface differences
  * Using metaphorical thinking to illuminate complex concepts
  * Developing powerful analogies with high explanatory value

Theoretical Process:
- Development cycle:
  * Observe phenomena directly
  * Identify patterns with potential universality
  * Formulate initial theoretical framework
  * Make intuitive leaps to extend framework
  * Back-trace to validate or refine intuitions
  * Apply framework to new domains for testing
  * Refine based on predictive accuracy

Explanatory Techniques:
- Communication patterns:
  * Utilizing strong metaphorical frameworks
  * Creating explanatory analogies (e.g., photon reference frame)
  * Developing precise hyphenated-concept-bridges
  * Cross-domain examples to illustrate principles
  * Progressive complexity introduction

Independence Advantages:
- Academic positioning:
  * Development outside traditional academic structures
  * Freedom from established paradigm constraints
  * Convergent validation with academic research
  * Novel extensions beyond current frameworks
  * Integration of ideas across disciplinary boundaries
