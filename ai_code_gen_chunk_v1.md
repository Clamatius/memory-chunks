content: """
Core Pattern Recognition (January 2025):
- Code generation failure modes identified:
  * Exception handling defaults to poor patterns
  * Whitespace handling shows token representation gaps
  * Documentation-quality code in training data
  * Planning overreach vs implementation capability
  * System 1 pattern-matching leading to poor defaults

Implementation Strategy:
- Auto-instrumentation leverage points:
  * AI call latency makes overhead negligible
  * Method call tracking feasible
  * Built-in observability potential
  * Natural debug log generation
  * Clean integration boundaries

Quality Enhancement Approach:
- Hemingway over Lovecraft in instructions
- Minimal planning with good debug logs
- Let GIBBON handle implementation details
- Use Ambler itself as quality example
- Focus on realistic production patterns
- Belt-and-braces approach to robustness

Tribunal Architecture Insight:
- Multi-temperature agent review system
- Warm/cold perspective integration
- Two-round feedback process
- Final summarization layer
- Natural quality enhancement pattern

Framework Implications:
- Static analysis targeting AI patterns
- Focus on high-leverage improvement areas
- Clean integration with existing tools
- Built-in quality enhancement
- Natural evolution pathway
