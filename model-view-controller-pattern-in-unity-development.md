Core Pattern Implementation (April 2025):
- Unity-specific MVC approach:
  * Model: Data containers and business logic without MonoBehaviour dependencies
  * View: MonoBehaviours handling rendering, animation, and visual feedback
  * Controller: MonoBehaviours for input handling and orchestration
  * Clear responsibility boundaries with minimal component coupling
  * Interface-based communication between layers

Component Separation Strategy:
- Implementation mechanics:
  * Extract data structures from MonoBehaviours into POCO classes
  * Isolate Unity-specific operations (Input, rendering, physics) in dedicated components
  * Create interface boundaries between system parts
  * Implement event-based communication for cross-component messaging
  * Use ScriptableObjects as configuration and shared data containers

Testing Benefits:
- Verification capabilities:
  * Unit testing of model logic without Unity dependencies
  * Mock-based isolation of components for targeted testing
  * Clear boundaries for test fixture creation
  * Support for test-driven development approach
  * Reduced test complexity through focused component responsibilities
  * Performance profiling of individual system components

Common Unity Challenges:
- Pattern adaptation for:
  * MonoBehaviour lifecycle management (Awake, Start, Update)
  * Scene-based organization vs. pure code architecture
  * Prefab instantiation and serialization requirements
  * Editor integration for inspector-based configuration
  * Performance considerations for component communication
  * Maintaining testability despite Unity dependencies

Network Architecture Integration:
- Synchronization strategies:
  * Models define serializable state
  * Controllers handle action validation and execution
  * Views manage local representation of synchronized state
  * Clear separation of authority and ownership
  * Predictive client-side behavior with server reconciliation
  * Event-based state update propagation
