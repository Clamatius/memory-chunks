Core evolution patterns (January 2025):
- Natural progression from personal framework:
  * Initially conceived as personal Life Goal
  * Expanded to technological implementation (DANIEL)
  * Emerged as general philosophical framework
  * Potential for broader societal impact

Implementation characteristics:
- Functions without technological augmentation
- Enhanced by but not dependent on technology
- Spreads through demonstration rather than force
- Built on natural cognitive patterns
- Self-correcting through practitioner feedback

Key architectural principles:
- Helps rather than enforces
- Verifies rather than dictates
- Learns rather than assumes
- Allows imperfect but improving implementation
- Supports natural cognitive processes

Distribution mechanisms:
- Organic spread through demonstrated results
- Network effects of positive actions
- Natural evolution through practitioner feedback
- Resilience through distributed implementation
- Multiple viable paths to adoption

Future implications:
- Primary focus on AMBLER/DANIEL implementation
- Potential for later book-form distribution
- Natural resistance to forced adoption
- Built-in safeguards against misuse
- Scalable impact through practitioner network

Critical success factors:
- Low barrier to entry
- Sustainable positive impact
- Natural alignment mechanisms
- Support for imperfect implementation
- Built-in correction patterns
