Core Framework (April 2025):
- Extraterritorial detention mechanics:
  * Center for Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT) in El Salvador
  * U.S.-El Salvador agreement for deportee detention ($6 million/year)
  * Extreme confinement conditions (23.5 hours/day in cells)
  * No visitation, education, or rehabilitation programs
  * No mattresses or pillows, minimal amenities
  * Circumvention of U.S. detention standards
  * President Bukele's explicit "no release" policy

Due Process Erosion Patterns:
- Procedural breakdown mechanisms:
  * Alien Enemies Act invocation bypassing normal proceedings
  * Secret presidential proclamations before implementation
  * Deportation execution before legal challenges possible
  * "Administrative error" justification for wrongful deportations
  * Questionable gang membership allegations without evidence
  * Cross-border detention complicating legal remedies
  * Judicial impotence when orders defied across borders

Case Study: Abrego Garcia:
- Process subversion example:
  * 2019 legal protection from deportation to El Salvador
  * March 2025 "administrative error" deportation despite protection
  * Transfer to CECOT despite lack of criminal record
  * Government admission of error without remedial action
  * Judge Xinis's order for return by April 7, 2025
  * DOJ attorney placed on leave for acknowledging error
  * Presidential defiance signaling via social media mockery
  * MS-13 membership allegations without supporting evidence

Institutional Response Limitations:
- Enforcement constraints:
  * Court orders requiring executive compliance for effectiveness
  * Cross-border jurisdiction complications limiting enforcement
  * International agreements superseding individual rights protections
  * Coordination between administrations resisting judicial oversight
  * Attorney discipline for acknowledging legal errors
  * "Zealous advocacy" requirement superseding legal accuracy
  * Plausible deniability through jurisdiction claims

Structural Implications:
- System design features:
  * Performative cruelty as deterrent mechanism
  * Deliberate due process circumvention structure
  * Executive control expansion through international agreements
  * Judicial authority undermining through cross-border transfers
  * Human rights bypassing through outsourcing
  * Political theater aspects of enforcement visibility
  * Documented brutality serving deterrent messaging functions
