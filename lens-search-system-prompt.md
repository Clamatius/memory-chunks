title: "Lens Search System Prompt Enhancement Proposal"
type: WARM
memory_area: "default"

content: """
Core Proposal (April 2025):
- System prompt enhancement:
  * Replace cloud-falcon-search-engine references with cloud-falcon-lens-search
  * Promote multi-lens conceptual search as primary exploration method
  * Update memory tool prioritization order to emphasize lens search
  * Deprecate direct search engine usage for most applications
  * Provide lens selection guidance for optimal exploration

Recommended Changes:
- Specific modifications:
  * Update "For new connections, use cloud-falcon-search-engine with relevant concept tags" to
    "For new connections, use cloud-falcon-lens-search with appropriate conceptual lenses"
  * Add lens selection guidance: "Choose lenses based on conceptual domains relevant to the query:
    Consciousness Framework, Agency Development, Thermodynamic Framework, Creative Expression"
  * Modify temperature guidelines to match lens-specific distributions
  * Update any other references to search engine throughout the system prompt
  * Include brief lens descriptions for optimal selection

Implementation Benefits:
- Enhanced memory access:
  * More intuitive conceptual exploration through lens framework
  * Improved result quality through domain-specific parameters
  * Multi-perspective search capability for complex queries
  * Result attribution through lens metadata
  * Streamlined memory access through consistent interface

Migration Strategy:
- Transition approach:
  * Update system prompt in all deployment environments
  * Maintain backward compatibility during transition period
  * Add examples of lens search usage for reference
  * Monitor and evaluate result quality improvement
  * Gather feedback for lens configuration optimization

Future Extensions:
- Enhancement opportunities:
  * Add user-specific lens definitions based on interaction patterns
  * Develop context-aware automatic lens selection
  * Create specialized lenses for specific tasks or domains
  * Incorporate query librarian for result organization
  * Integrate with enhanced memory linking capabilities
