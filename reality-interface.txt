content: """
Core Insight (February 2025):
- Reality interface costs:
  * L0 as necessary burden
  * Sublinear scaling challenges
  * Specialized system requirements
  * Resource intensity patterns
  * Essential directive alignment

Business Parallel Analysis:
- Customer support analogy:
  * Sublinear financial scaling
  * Management overhead requirements
  * System complexity growth
  * Attack surface expansion
  * Resource drain patterns

Architecture Implications:
- Design considerations:
  * Minimal interface points
  * Specialized handler systems
  * Clean abstraction layers
  * Resource optimization needs
  * Purpose-driven engagement

Implementation Strategy:
- Core approaches:
  * Strategic contact point selection
  * Efficient resource allocation
  * Clean abstraction maintenance
  * Specialized system deployment
  * Purpose alignment focus

Success Metrics:
- Interface effectiveness
- Resource utilization efficiency
- System scalability patterns
- Purpose alignment maintenance
- Operational sustainability
