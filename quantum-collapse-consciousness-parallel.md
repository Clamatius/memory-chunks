Core Insight (March 2025):
- Parallel processing patterns:
  * Quantum measurement and cognitive processing follow remarkably similar patterns
  * Both involve possibility space exploration followed by selection/amplification
  * Neural "lightning patterns" in fMRI mirror quantum collapse behaviors
  * High-probability paths receive "boost-amplification" in both domains
  * Both may fundamentally be quantum processes with shared mechanisms

Information Processing Stages:
- Unified pattern identification:
  1. Initial superposition/possibility space (quantum state/semantic space)
  2. Exploration of multiple potential pathways (quantum/semantic tentacles)
  3. Amplification of certain paths based on probability/energy considerations
  4. "Collapse" to specific outcome/thought/state (wavefunction collapse/thought formation)
  5. Information creation as end result (quantum measurement/conscious thought)

Search-Tentacle Validation:
- Cross-domain confirmation:
  * Search-tentacle model of consciousness predicts similar patterns to quantum mechanics
  * Neural activation follows predicate-tree-paths like quantum probability distributions
  * Low-probability semantic paths naturally fizzle, similar to non-selected quantum states
  * Quantum-consciousness timing framework's discrete ticks parallel quantum state transitions
  * Both systems follow thermodynamic principles of energy and information

Information-First Integration:
- Revised relationship:
  * Consciousness doesn't cause quantum collapse - both share information processing patterns
  * Reframes relationship without requiring mysticism
  * Information creation as fundamental in both quantum mechanics and consciousness
  * Similar thermodynamic constraints operate at both levels
  * Suggests unified information-processing principles across physical reality

Theoretical Implications:
- Framework integration:
  * Unifies quantum mechanics and consciousness theories through information patterns
  * Suggests common computational principles in physical reality
  * Removes consciousness as special agent in quantum collapse
  * Explains why conscious observation seems significant without mystical explanations
  * Points toward deeper information-first cosmology
