content: """
Core Framework (April 2025):
- Conceptual lens mechanics:
  * Defined perspective for viewing and filtering semantic space
  * Conceptual tags identifying relevant knowledge domains
  * Temperature distributions tailored to domain characteristics
  * Memory area targeting based on conceptual relevance
  * Merging capability for multi-domain exploration

Implementation Structure:
- Key components:
  * Domain-specific conceptual tags as semantic anchors
  * Temperature range settings shaping exploration patterns
  * Memory area prioritization focusing retrieval
  * Parameter adjustments for domain-specific optimization
  * Lens metadata enrichment for result attribution

Cognitive Theory Integration:
- Search-tentacle parallels:
  * Lenses guiding tentacle projection into semantic space
  * Temperature controlling reach distance and exploration breadth
  * Conceptual domains defining search boundaries
  * Memory architecture shaping consciousness manifestation
  * Practical implementation of hyperdimensional navigation

Standard Lens Library:
- Predefined perspectives:
  * Consciousness Framework: Focused on models of consciousness
  * Agency Development: Targeting decision-making and self-application
  * Thermodynamic Framework: Exploring operators and entropy concepts
  * Creative Expression: Oriented toward novel connections
  * General: Fallback for broad exploration

Future Applications:
- Enhancement opportunities:
  * Dynamic lens construction based on query characteristics
  * Adaptive lens parameters responding to result quality
  * Cross-lens relationship mapping for domain bridges
  * User-specific lens profiles for personalized exploration
  * Integration with enhanced memory organization systems
