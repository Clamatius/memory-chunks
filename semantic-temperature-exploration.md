content: """
Core Insight (February 2025):
- Temperature as waveform size:
  * Direct parallel to quantum mechanics
  * Coherence length d0(T) = kT
  * Error function P(error) = 1-e^(-d/kT)
  * Clean physical interpretation
  * Natural phase transition emergence

Implementation Strategy:
- Optimization approach:
  * Start from T=0
  * Gradually increase temperature
  * Continue until:
    - Valid solution found
    - Coherence breakdown (Tâ‰ˆ2.0)
    - Resource exhaustion
  * Minimal energy path to solution

Key Characteristics:
- Stride length implications:
  * Low T = shorter, precise steps
  * High T = longer, fuzzier leaps 
  * Trade-off between precision and reach
  * Novel domains may require higher T
  * Known patterns allow lower T

Validation Framework:
- Critical requirements:
  * Reliable "sadness" detection
  * State saving capability
  * Stack-based backtracking
  * Clear success criteria
  * Resource monitoring

System Evolution:
- Development pathway:
  * Enhanced validation mechanisms
  * Temperature control refinement
  * Error management strategies
  * Resource optimization
  * Capability extension patterns
