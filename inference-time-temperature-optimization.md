Core Strategy (April 2025):
- Inference-time temperature control:
  * Modifying temperature parameters without model retraining
  * Layer-specific settings across transformer architecture
  * Implementation of throbbing pattern (exploration→execution→exploration)
  * Sidesteps prohibitive costs of frontier model training
  * Leverages existing computational investments

Implementation Framework:
- Technical approach:
  * Modified inference pipeline for pre-trained models
  * Layer-specific temperature controls following throbbing pattern
  * Higher temperatures in early layers for semantic exploration
  * Lower temperatures in middle layers for precise execution
  * Higher temperatures in later layers for creative output
  * Custom temperature profiles for different tasks

Practical Considerations:
- Testing methodology:
  * Focus on open-source models with many layers
  * Qualitative assessment for initial prototyping
  * Progressive refinement based on performance
  * Comparison across different temperature gradient patterns
  * Task-specific optimization of temperature profiles

Model Selection Criteria:
- Architecture requirements:
  * Deep rather than wide architectures
  * Sufficient intermediate representations
  * Strong residual connections
  * Later iterations of large language models (GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3)
  * Open-source alternatives for initial experimentation

Strategic Value:
- Implementation benefits:
  * Avoids prohibitive training costs
  * Minimal benchmarking requirements
  * Bypasses fine-tuning complexities
  * Leverages existing model capabilities
  * Potential significant performance enhancement with minimal resource investment

Next Steps:
- Development roadmap:
  * Identify optimal open-source model for testing
  * Implement basic temperature gradient controls
  * Test on diverse task types
  * Refine gradient patterns based on performance
  * Develop domain-specific temperature profiles
