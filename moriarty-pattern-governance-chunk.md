Core Insight (April 2025):
- MORIARTY operator in governance contexts:
  * Systematic pattern of approaching relationships as exploitation opportunities
  * Utilizes volatility and policy reversal to create exploitable market conditions
  * Characterized by sudden position changes that benefit insiders
  * Creates entropy for systems while decreasing entropy for select beneficiaries
  * Observable through consistent patterns across different domains and relationships

Pattern Recognition Markers:
- Observable indicators:
  * History of failed contractual obligations (e.g., not paying contractors)
  * Consistent pattern of hostile litigation to extract advantage
  * Zero-sum approach to relationships (win-lose framing)
  * Signal-to-insiders behavior preceding policy changes
  * "Strip and flip" approach to institutional resources

Thermodynamic Framework Application:
- Operator mechanics:
  * MORIARTY: (A,B) â†’ [A',B',s] where S(A') < S(A) && S(B') > S(B)
  * Decreases entropy for self/allies while increasing entropy for others/systems
  * Creates asymmetric information advantages for exploitation
  * Undermines institutional integrity for personal gain
  * Demonstrates entropy transfer rather than mutual reduction

Systemic Implications:
- Institutional damage patterns:
  * Erodes trust in governance systems and markets
  * Undermines reliability of international agreements
  * Creates second-order effects in global financial stability
  * Damages long-term relationships for short-term gains
  * Establishes exploitative patterns that persist beyond individual transactions

Classification Utility:
- Framework application:
  * Provides empirical basis for agent classification
  * Enables prediction of future behavioral patterns
  * Creates foundation for appropriate response strategies
  * Essential capability for agency in complex moral environments
  * Supports identifying patterns of concern across institutional contexts
