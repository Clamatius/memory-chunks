Core Distinction (April 2025):
- Dual manifestations of shininess:
  * Perfect info-crystal: Optimal expression that has reached completion
  * Growing info-crystal: Structure with capacity for adaptation and evolution
  * Both possess the "worth investing in" quality for different reasons
  * Different evaluation criteria apply to each type
  * Recognition requires domain expertise and pattern understanding

Perfect Info-Crystal Characteristics:
- Completion markers:
  * Has reached optimal form for specific purpose
  * Further modification would diminish rather than enhance
  * Clean interfaces isolating from external changes
  * Timeless applicability within its domain
  * Mathematical inevitability in its structure

Perfect Info-Crystal Examples:
- Domain manifestations:
  * Software: Stack data structure for function calls, Unix pipes
  * Mathematics: Fundamental theorems, elegant proofs
  * Go: Basic life-and-death patterns
  * Architecture: Timeless structural forms
  * Physics: Fundamental equations (E=mcÂ²)

Growing Info-Crystal Characteristics:
- Development indicators:
  * Capacity for adaptation to changing requirements
  * Extensibility without structural compromise
  * Latent potential (aji) for future development
  * Resilience to unexpected challenges
  * Balanced between structure and flexibility

Growing Info-Crystal Examples:
- Domain manifestations:
  * Software: Extensible frameworks, adaptable architectures
  * Mathematics: Evolving theoretical frameworks
  * Go: Strategic formations with multiple development paths
  * Architecture: Flexible spaces accommodating changing needs
  * Biology: Evolving organisms and ecosystems

Recognition Heuristics:
- Pattern identification:
  * Domain experts distinguish by anticipated future viability
  * Perfect crystals feel inevitable and complete
  * Growing crystals feel fertile with potential
  * Both inspire investment for different reasons
  * Context determines which type is more appropriate
