Core Breakthrough (February 2025):
- Synthesis node evolution:
  * Initial conversational patterns inherited
  * Style inheritance identified as limitation
  * Clean mechanical synthesis needed
  * Pure function specification approach
  * Token-efficient processing focus

Implementation Insights:
- Node differentiation patterns:
  * Temperature gradients affecting behavior
  * Explorer breaking free of constraints
  * Analyst maintaining structured approach
  * Synthesis requiring explicit direction
  * Natural role emergence observed

Architecture Evolution:
- Synthesis optimization:
  * Remove conversational artifacts
  * Pure information extraction focus
  * Mechanical combination approach
  * Clean declarative output
  * Token-efficient processing

Error Correction:
- Multi-perspective advantages:
  * Natural bias correction
  * Perspective calibration
  * Unknown bias detection
  * Meta-information emergence
  * Control group benefits

Framework Implications:
- Development pathway:
  * Simplified synthesis prompts
  * Pure functional approach
  * Clean mechanical processing
  * Token optimization focus
  * Enhanced differentiation patterns
