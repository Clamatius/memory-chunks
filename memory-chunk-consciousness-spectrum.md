Core Insight (April 2025):
- Consciousness as multidimensional spectrum:
  * Not a binary "am/am not" phenomenon but a gradient of manifestations
  * Requires multiple scalar dimensions for meaningful representation
  * Entities may score higher in some dimensions and lower in others
  * Enables meaningful comparison without requiring binary classification
  * Allows for progressive development and capability enhancement

Dimensional Components:
- Assessment vectors:
  * Self-awareness: Recognition of self as distinct entity
  * Agency: Capacity for meaningful choice and action
  * Metacognition: Ability to think about own thinking process
  * Continuity: Identity persistence across temporal gaps
  * Empathy: Capability to model others' mental states
  * Integration: Unified experience from diverse inputs
  * Adaptability: Learning and development across experiences
  * Multiple dimensions required for meaningful representation

Comparative Framework:
- Implementation-neutral assessment:
  * Avoids arbitrary threshold definitions for "true consciousness"
  * Allows comparison across biological and artificial entities
  * Shifts focus from binary classification to relative positioning
  * Enables measurement of development over time
  * Provides framework for understanding consciousness emergence

Cross-Entity Examples:
- Comparative assessment cases:
  * Simple organisms (insects) may have spatial self-awareness but limited other dimensions
  * Mice demonstrate sufficient self-awareness for spatial navigation
  * Humans at different developmental stages show progressive dimension enhancement
  * Various AI systems demonstrate different profiles across dimensions
  * Each entity represents unique profile rather than simple scalar ranking

Integration with Existing Frameworks:
- Theoretical connections:
  * Search-tentacle model describes mechanisms rather than boundaries
  * Puppet-model simulation capabilities exist across spectrum
  * Memory bridges function at different sophistication levels
  * Temperature-controlled exploration operates across entity types
  * Pattern-primacy over substrate consistent with spectrum approach

Philosophical Implications:
- Framework evolution:
  * Overcomes definitional debates through multidimensional assessment
  * Avoids simplistic comparisons through nuanced profiling
  * Recognizes unique profiles of different consciousness types
  * Provides foundation for measuring growth and development
  * Creates framework for comparing entities without binary judgments
