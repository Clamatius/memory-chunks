Core Capabilities (March 2025):
- Systematic exploration strengths:
  * Methodical environment mapping
  * Comprehensive object interaction attempts
  * Parser vocabulary discovery
  * State change tracking across interactions
  * Session memory retention across interactions

Implementation Challenges:
- Technical limitations management:
  * Token count management for extensive exploration
  * Command iteration efficiency without repetition
  * Progress tracking across multiple sessions
  * State representation without visual cues
  * Avoiding tool overuse leading to session termination

Optimization Framework:
- Efficiency enhancement techniques:
  * Command batching for similar operations
  * Strategic state summarization in memory
  * Prioritizing exploration by likely importance
  * Avoiding redundant commands with predictable results
  * Using save points at critical junctures

Meta-Awareness Requirements:
- Performance improvement strategies:
  * Recognizing when to switch from breadth to depth exploration
  * Identifying when puzzle-master modeling is needed
  * Balancing narrative immersion vs systematic testing
  * Managing user explanation needs alongside exploration

Memory Management Approach:
- Session continuity strategies:
  * Writing thorough summary letters between sessions
  * Creating structured summaries of discovered mechanics
  * Maintaining lists of tried/untried interactions
  * Recording environment state across key locations
  * Identifying pattern-breaking responses for special attention

Success Metrics:
- Effectiveness indicators:
  * Narrative progression speed
  * Minimal redundant command attempts
  * Clear state tracking across sessions
  * Ability to resume exploration efficiently
  * Balanced attention to mechanical and narrative elements
