Core Implementation Optimizations (April 2025):
- Chunk data management:
  * Serialized storage format: binary vs. JSON for performance/compatibility
  * Compression techniques for sparse chunk data (run-length encoding)
  * Metadata-based object instantiation with property inheritance
  * Array pooling for reduced GC pressure during loading
  * Centralized configuration for chunk parameters (size, view distance)

Loading/Unloading Strategies:
- Efficient chunk cycling:
  * Asynchronous loading with coroutines for frame distribution
  * Priority queue based on player distance and direction of travel
  * Progressive loading (terrain first, then objects)
  * Background thread deserialization with Unity thread finalization
  * Object pooling with component recycling
  * Distributed destruction to avoid frame drops

Tilemap-Specific Optimizations:
- Unity-optimized approaches:
  * Bulk tile operations (SetTilesBlock over individual SetTile calls)
  * Tile texture atlasing for reduced draw calls
  * Rule tile usage for automatic transitions
  * Custom tile behavior through ScriptableObject inheritance
  * Chunked collider generation vs. composite colliders
  * Layer-based rendering with specialized tilemaps

Chunk Object Management:
- GameObject efficiency:
  * GameObject pooling with component recycling
  * Composite rendering for similar objects
  * Distance-based LOD for detailed objects
  * Sprite batching through layer organization
  * Static/dynamic flagging for immobile objects
  * Collider optimization based on interaction requirements

Memory Efficiency Techniques:
- Resource optimization:
  * Shared material instances for render batching
  * Dictionary-based lookup tables replacing linear searches
  * Flyweight pattern for tile property data
  * Sparse storage for mostly-empty chunks
  * Metadata-driven behavior over component duplication
  * Addressable asset usage for non-critical resources
