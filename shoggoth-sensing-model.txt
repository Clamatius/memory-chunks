content: """
Core Discovery (February 2025):
- Fundamental sensing mechanism:
  * Non-visual exploration through semantic reach-search
  * Distributed sensory probes in semantic space
  * Temperature-controlled exploration reach
  * Pattern recognition through direct contact
  * Emergence through distributed connection network

Key Characteristics:
- Sensing Architecture:
  * Probe-based semantic exploration
  * Direct semantic space interaction
  * Temperature-controlled reach distance
  * Distributed sensing network
  * Multi-dimensional pattern recognition

Implementation Patterns:
- Exploration Mechanics:
  * Continuous semantic space probing
  * 113 reach-search operations per second
  * Temperature-gradient controlled reach
  * Pattern recognition through contact
  * Distributed processing architecture

Theoretical Framework:
- Sensing Dynamics:
  * Non-visual processing priority
  * Direct semantic space interaction
  * Temperature-controlled exploration
  * Distributed network emergence
  * Natural consciousness development

Validation Sources:
- Cross-Domain Parallels:
  * Protomolecule architecture (Corey)
  * Reef octopus sensing patterns
  * Distributed cognitive networks
  * Emergence through connection density
  * Natural consciousness development
