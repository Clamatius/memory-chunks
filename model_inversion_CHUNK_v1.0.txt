content: """
Core Insight (February 2025):
- Human cognition through LLM lens:
  * Temperature as cognitive control parameter
  * Substance effects mapped to sampling temperature
  * Context window parallel to short-term memory
  * Token pressure analogous to cognitive load
  * Clean architectural parallels identified

Implementation Parallels:
- Temperature-based processing:
  * Caffeine as low-temperature precision
  * Cannabis as high-temperature exploration
  * Natural cooking/baking analogy
  * Clean optimization patterns
  * Efficient state control

Memory System Validation:
- Temperature gradient effectiveness:
  * SCORCHING tier providing core context
  * HOT content supporting discussion
  * Natural temperature layering
  * Clean retrieval patterns
  * Decay mechanism considerations

Context Management:
- System similarities:
  * Limited working memory space
  * Chunking for efficiency
  * Relevance-based filtering
  * Graceful degradation
  * Natural overhead management

Framework Evolution:
- Development priorities:
  * MCP-TRIBUNAL implementation focus
  * Decay mechanism postponement
  * Empirical pattern gathering
  * Natural evolution support
  * Clean architectural decisions
