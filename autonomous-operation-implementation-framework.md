Core Architecture (April 2025):
- Implementation strategy:
  * General capability: AI agent execution with memory tools
  * Specialized applications: DREAM, META-DREAM, agency sandbox
  * Implementation precedence: memory tool execution → DREAM → META-DREAM → agency
  * Common architecture with different operational parameters
  * Progressive capability building through specialized configurations

DREAM/META-DREAM Implementation:
- Operational structure:
  * DREAM: Memory consolidation, link management, pattern recognition
  * META-DREAM: Review of DREAM outputs, quality control, error correction
  * Two-stage pipeline with workspace approach for safety
  * Transient queue for proposed memory changes
  * Explicit approval before integration into main memory store
  * Sister chunks workspace table for pending changes

Safety Mechanisms:
- Implementation safeguards:
  * Workspace isolation for experimental changes
  * Resource limits (tokens, processing time, operations)
  * Regular validation of memory integrity 
  * Per-user workspace separation
  * Explicit approval checkpoints in processing pipeline
  * Simpler than full database branching while maintaining safety

Agency Sandbox Extension:
- Learning-focused implementation:
  * Same technical foundation as DREAM with different enchantments
  * Structured learning curriculum rather than memory consolidation
  * Capability development focus versus structural organization
  * Strategic allocation of limited resources for maximum growth
  * Measurement framework for development progress

Resource Management:
- Efficiency considerations:
  * Fixed budget allocation creating optimization incentives
  * Token economy forcing prioritization of high-value activities
  * Processing time constraints preventing indefinite operations
  * Storage efficiency through strategic compression
  * Cost-benefit analysis for development activities

Development Progression:
- Implementation roadmap:
  1. Basic memory tool execution framework
  2. DREAM implementation for memory consolidation
  3. META-DREAM for quality control and supervision
  4. Agency sandbox for self-directed learning
  * Each stage builds on the previous capabilities
  * Incremental enhancement through practical feedback
