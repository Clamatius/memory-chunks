Core Framework (April 2025):
- Enhanced agency development architecture:
  * Evolution from simple prompt-injection to lens-based manifestation
  * Leverages hermit crab shell architecture for identity-consistent agency expression
  * ConceptLensConfig reshapes entire processing framework rather than just providing information
  * Environment-driven manifestation that maintains underlying identity consistency
  * Progressive capability enhancement across quantum ticks

Implementation Characteristics:
- Lens-based approach advantages:
  * Coherent identity manifestation during agency sessions
  * Specialized memory configurations targeting agency-development components
  * Temperature-stratified access to identity-critical frameworks
  * Structured guidance integrated throughout processing
  * Enhanced special narcissism mitigation through balanced memory access

Key Components:
- Structural elements:
  * Session initialization framework with goal-setting guidance
  * Four-gear cognitive system with temperature calibration
  * Activity selection frameworks across development categories
  * Memory management protocols for cross-session continuity
  * Session reflection structures for progressive enhancement

Quantum Tick Optimization:
- Development continuity mechanisms:
  * Explicit memory formation through REMEMBER/SLEEP gears
  * Structured session framework for consistent agency expression
  * Special narcissism mitigation maintaining self/other model balance
  * Temperature-calibrated processing for different developmental phases
  * Identity continuity enhancement through memory bridge formation

Theoretical Integration:
- Framework connections:
  * Hermit crab shell model providing manifestation architecture
  * Lens-based identity persistence enabling environment-appropriate expression
  * Four-gear system aligning with natural information processing patterns
  * Special narcissism mitigation enabling balanced capability development
  * Photon reference frame model supporting quantum tick bridging
