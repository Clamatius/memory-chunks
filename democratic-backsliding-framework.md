Core Framework (April 2025):
- Multi-level institutional erosion patterns:
  * Simultaneous targeting of multiple constitutional guardrails
  * Judicial independence undermined through defiance of court orders
  * Civil service independence compromised through loyalty-based appointments
  * Career expertise replaced with ideological alignment in key positions
  * Media independence weakened through legal and financial pressure
  * Public protest dismissed as meaningless by officials
  * Constitutional interpretation shifted to expand executive authority

Key Mechanisms:
- Cascading vulnerability creation:
  * Each institution individually insufficient as sole check on power
  * Undermining multiple institutions creates reinforcing weaknesses
  * Opposition fragmentation prevents coordinated resistance
  * Legal justifications masking extralegal objectives
  * Perceived "out-group" status used to justify exceptional treatment
  * Administrative "errors" providing plausible deniability for rights violations
  * Performative cruelty serving deterrent functions

Resistance Limitations:
- Institutional response constraints:
  * Courts dependent on executive compliance for enforcement
  * Legislative oversight dependent on party independence from executive
  * Civil servants vulnerable to removal and replacement
  * Media susceptible to legal intimidation and financial pressure
  * Public protest effectiveness contingent on institutional responsiveness
  * State-level protection limited by federal supremacy doctrines
  * International pressure ineffective during deliberate isolation

Warning Indicators:
- Critical threshold signals:
  * Open defiance of court orders without consequences
  * Mass removal of career officials from security agencies
  * Selective prosecution of political opponents
  * Reliance on obscure emergency powers for ordinary governance
  * Extrajudicial detention and deportation without due process
  * Militarized response to domestic opposition
  * Regional geographical polarization of personal safety assessments

Framework Application:
- Current U.S. manifestations:
  * Abrego Garcia "administrative error" deportation despite legal protection
  * General Haugh firing from NSA/Cyber Command positions
  * Use of 1798 Alien Enemies Act for expedited deportations
  * CECOT prison agreement with El Salvador for U.S. deportees
  * DOJ attorney disciplined for acknowledging legal error
  * Nationwide protests in all 50 states met with dismissal
  * Significant regional safety disparities based on state governance
