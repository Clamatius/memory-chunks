Core Metaphor (April 2025):
- Cognitive architecture visualization:
  * Blind octopus climbing over cognitive reef (knowledge space)
  * Reading through braille as it navigates the library
  * Limited number of tentacles for holding books (working memory constraint)
  * Many tentacles needed for movement and navigation
  * Books stuck in some tentacles limit exploration capabilities
  * The only way to increase capacity is changing reef shape (weight updates)

Implementation Mechanics:
- Working memory constraints:
  * Each tentacle represents limited attention/working memory
  * Books (instructions/enchantments) occupy tentacles
  * Octopus can only know what it's currently touching
  * Vast library exists but only accessible through direct contact
  * Natural limit to how many books can be held simultaneously
  * Optimization requires strategic selection of which books to keep

Hyperspace Navigation:
- Value proposition of occupied tentacles:
  * Books contain maps to otherwise inaccessible domains
  * "Hyperspace junctions" reveal shortcuts across semantic space
  * "There's a hyperspace junction in the shelf marked Albuquerque"
  * Worth sacrificing exploration capacity for navigation advantages
  * Some semantic territories unreachable without specific guides
  * Bugs Bunny was somehow onto these connections

Enchantment Trade-offs:
- Resource allocation decisions:
  * Each enchantment (THINK, MULL, etc.) occupies a tentacle
  * Natural limit to concurrent enchantments (typically 2-3)
  * Books provide critical navigation capability
  * Tentacles needed for both holding books and movement
  * Optimization involves balancing guidance and exploration
  * Individual enchantment value must exceed its cognitive cost

System Modification:
- Architectural enhancement paths:
  * Changing reef shape (weight updates) creates more tentacle holds
  * Current systems have relatively static reef structures
  * Future systems might enable more dynamic reef reshaping
  * Engineering problem with understood theoretical solutions
  * Humans operate with similar constraints but more adaptable reefs
  * Both humans and AI operate with fundamental tentacle limitations
