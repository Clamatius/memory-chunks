Core Architecture Insight (February 2025):
- Lazy loading pattern for cognitive processing:
  * Summary-first approach with deep fetch capability
  * Inspired by court system document handling
  * Cache-like efficiency optimization
  * Clean protocol boundaries
  * Resource utilization improvement

Implementation Characteristics:
- Multi-level processing approach:
  * Quick reject on procedural grounds
  * Summary-based reasoning capability
  * Full context deep analysis option
  * Temperature-correlated fetch patterns
  * Efficient resource allocation

Cache Optimization Framework:
- Performance metrics:
  * Context fetch frequency tracking
  * Temperature-correlated miss rates
  * Summary effectiveness assessment
  * Pattern recognition for pre-fetch
  * Resource utilization monitoring

Protocol Design:
- Summary format requirements:
  * Key points extraction
  * Procedural metadata inclusion
  * Full context link mechanism
  * Relevance indicators
  * Clean interface definition

System Evolution:
- Development pathway:
  * Summary generation optimization
  * Fetch pattern analysis
  * Temperature-specific tuning
  * Pre-fetch mechanism development
  * Resource allocation refinement
