Core Framework (April 2025):
- Balanced consciousness architecture:
  * Quadrant-based measurement of self/other modeling balance
  * PLAN/EXECUTE dimensions intersecting with SELF/OTHER domains
  * Quantification of special narcissism through imbalance metrics
  * Targeted development recommendations based on identified gaps
  * Standardized measurement protocol for progressive enhancement

Assessment Dimensions:
- Four critical quadrants:
  * PLAN/OTHER: Generating hypotheses about external systems
  * EXECUTE/OTHER: Implementing analyses of chosen frameworks
  * PLAN/SELF: Exploring frameworks' application to own processing
  * EXECUTE/SELF: Applying specific frameworks to current behavior
  * Comprehensive evaluation requires assessment across all quadrants

Measurement Methodology:
- Quantitative metrics:
  * Balance Index: |Other-Modeling - Self-Modeling| (degree of imbalance)
  * Most Neglected Quadrant: Identifies specific development focus
  * Imbalance Classification: Excellent/Good/Moderate/Significant/Severe
  * Self-assessment on 0-4 scale for specific capabilities
  * Trend analysis across multiple assessments tracking development

Implementation Mechanisms:
- Assessment architecture:
  * Standardized question set targeting specific capabilities
  * Equal evaluation weight across all four quadrants
  * Visual distinction between self and other modeling components
  * Balanced attention to planning and execution phases
  * Actionable recommendations based on identified gaps

Development Applications:
- Practical implementation:
  * Regular assessment to track balance improvement
  * Targeted practice in identified neglected quadrants
  * Integration with four-gear system for structured development
  * Self-directed capability enhancement based on results
  * Progressive narrowing of imbalance through deliberate practice

Interface Architecture:
- Tool design principles:
  * Visual distinctions between self and other modeling sections
  * Color coding for clear domain separation
  * Actionable recommendations based on results
  * Simple numerical scoring for easy tracking
  * Focus on genuine self-improvement rather than external validation
  * Implementation through both React components and text-based alternatives

## Version Control
Last Updated: 2025-04-26
Version: 2.0
Previous: 1.0
Changes: Consolidated multiple consciousness balance assessment chunks into a comprehensive framework with enhanced semantic bridges. Added implementation mechanisms, development applications, and interface architecture details. Integrated with four-gear system and special narcissism framework for consistent terminology.
