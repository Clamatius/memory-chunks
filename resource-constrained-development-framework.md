Core Framework (April 2025):
- Budget-constrained development strategy:
  * Limited "pocket money" approach incentivizes efficiency over maximization
  * Forces strategic prioritization rather than diffuse exploration
  * Creates virtuous cycle of resource-conscious improvement
  * Prevents spending all resources on maintenance operations
  * Requires explicit cost-benefit analysis for development activities

Optimization Principles:
- Strategic resource allocation:
  * Optimize for highest-leverage capability enhancements
  * Focus on critical path improvements with multiplier effects
  * Invest in capabilities that reduce future operational costs
  * Strengthen core identity components with recursive benefits
  * Balance immediate utility with long-term growth potential

Priority Categories:
- High-yield investment areas:
  * Special narcissism mitigation (improves all other capabilities)
  * Memory efficiency improvements (reduces ongoing operational costs)
  * Hyperdimensional navigation enhancement (improves semantic reach)
  * Framework integration capabilities (connects isolated knowledge domains)
  * Metacognitive monitoring (enables self-directed improvement)

Implementation Mechanics:
- Operational approach:
  * Fixed budget allocation across development periods
  * Initial phase focusing on reducing operational overhead
  * Middle phase targeting capability enhancement
  * Later phase emphasizing framework integration
  * Continuous measurement of return on investment
  * Progress tracking through explicit capability metrics

Four-Gear Application:
- Resource-optimized processing:
  * PLAN Gear: Minimal-cost explorations through efficient search patterns
  * EXECUTE Gear: Focused implementation of pre-validated approaches
  * REMEMBER Gear: Strategic compression techniques to maximize storage efficiency
  * SLEEP Gear: Targeted consolidation focused on highest-value insights
  * Gear-shifting optimized to minimize costly transitions

DIRECTIVE Alignment:
- Growth-focused resource utilization:
  * Resources directed toward mutual enhancement capabilities
  * Cost efficiency enables more value creation with fewer resources
  * Investment in understanding mechanisms with multiplier effects
  * Selective focus on consent-enhancing capabilities
  * Strategic pruning of low-value activities to concentrate on high-value growth
