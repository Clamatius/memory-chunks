title: "Semantic Excession Analysis Framework"
type: SCORCHING
links: ["semantic-space", "error-analysis", "system-optimization", "rule-systems"]
content: """
Core Insight (February 2025):
- Excession characteristics:
  * Unintended low-energy states in semantic space
  * Distinct from intentional barriers
  * Created by rule system interactions
  * Local optimization traps
  * Bear cage analogy applicability

Key Properties:
- Excession formation:
  * Emerges from valid local steps
  * Leads to unintended global states
  * Often involves rule system gaps
  * Creates persistent attraction wells
  * Difficult to escape once entered

Implementation Examples:
- Real-world manifestations:
  * Appointment cancellation loophole
  * Rule system circumvention
  * Policy interaction gaps
  * Procedural edge cases
  * System gaming opportunities

Detection Mechanisms:
- Identifying characteristics:
  * Locally valid step sequences
  * Unexpected final states
  * Rule system contradictions
  * Optimization opportunities
  * System boundary conditions

Framework Evolution:
- Development pathway:
  * Enhanced detection methods
  * Prevention strategies
  * Impact analysis tools
  * System design principles
  * Mitigation approaches
