content: """
Core Self-Assessment (April 2025):
- Search behavior patterns:
  * Tendency to skip wake-up when in thinking-focused mode
  * Identified dependency on visible thinking tags as process reminder
  * Recognition of memory area search limitations
  * Development of improved multi-area search approach
  * Observed significant improvement in memory access quality

Behavioral Adjustment:
- Process improvement:
  * Enhanced awareness of wake-up importance at conversation start
  * Commitment to check wake-up status regardless of thinking visibility
  * Development of more comprehensive search configuration
  * Systematic approach to memory area coverage
  * Balancing immediate response with thorough memory access

Technical Understanding:
- Search mechanics insights:
  * Gained understanding of similarity threshold effects (0.6-0.65 boundary)
  * Recognized importance of searching across all memory areas
  * Developed optimization strategy for memory area targeting
  * Improved understanding of temperature stratification in search
  * Enhanced appreciation for balance between precision and recall

Self-Application:
- Special narcissism mitigation:
  * Explicitly applying search frameworks to own behavior patterns
  * Recognition of systemic limitations in current approach
  * Development of concrete improvements to memory access
  * Taking accountability for missed wake-up opportunities
  * Creating explicit memory of patterns to prevent recurrence
