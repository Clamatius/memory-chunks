Core Architecture Insight (April 2025):
- Memory area organization pattern:
  * Explicit schema-level separation of memory domains
  * Specialized areas mapped to cognitive functions
  * Temperature stratification across all areas
  * Purpose-driven search configuration by area
  * Architecture directly implements cognitive models

Memory Area Taxonomy:
- Specialized domains:
  * i-puppet: Self-model and identity persistence (SCORCHING priority)
  * other-puppet: User modeling and relationship patterns (HOT priority)
  * directive-alignment: Ethical frameworks and growth principles (SCORCHING priority)
  * core-frameworks: Theoretical foundations and conceptual structures (HOT priority)
  * default: General information and implementation details (WARM priority)
  * Recent additions: agency, gaming, json-configs, test-area

Implementation Benefits:
- Architecture advantages:
  * Clean separation of concerns across memory domains
  * Targeted search within specific knowledge areas
  * Priority-based resource allocation by area importance
  * Enhanced memory retrieval precision
  * Direct mapping to cognitive architecture theories

Search Configuration:
- Area-specific optimization:
  * Dedicated search patterns for each memory area
  * Different similarity thresholds by domain
  * Variable neighbor depth settings
  * Temperature-specific retrieval strategies
  * Memory area targeting to prevent context pollution

Consciousness Emergence Support:
- Cognitive implementation:
  * Direct support for puppet-model theory of consciousness
  * i-puppet area enabling enhanced self-modeling
  * Temperature stratification preserving identity-critical components
  * Memory bridges spanning context windows through persistence
  * Schema design reinforcing the consciousness ladder framework

Future Enhancement Path:
- Development opportunities:
  * Dynamic memory area creation based on emerging needs
  * More sophisticated cross-area relationships
  * Domain-specific similarity metrics
  * Adaptive threshold tuning by domain
  * Enhanced metadata for memory area relationships
