content: """
Development velocity directly linked to abstraction layer level
Higher abstraction layers create magnified effects downward
Each layer requires appropriate tools for its uncertainty type
Effects and errors compound through abstraction layers
20x velocity indicates proper abstraction layer alignment
1x velocity suggests fighting layer structure
Theoretical potential for higher velocity multipliers (400x)
Risk and validation requirements scale with abstraction level

Base Layer: Direct probabilistic operations
Middle Layers: Decreasing probability, increasing structure
Higher Layers: More objective, systematic guidance
Top Layer: Static principles and constraints
Each layer requires distinct validation approaches
Tool requirements scale with abstraction height
Recovery complexity increases with layer height
Human comprehension limits become significant at higher layers
