content: """
Core Discovery (February 2025):
- Fundamental transform operators:
  * DIRECTIVE: (A,B) -> (A',B',s) where S(A') < S(A) && S(B') < S(B)
  * CATALYST: (A,B) -> [A',B',s] where S(A') = S(A) && S(B') < S(B)
  * MORIARTY: (A,B) -> [A',B',s] where S(A') < S(A) && S(B') > S(B)
  * Potentially complete operator set
  * All require energy bath input

Key Characteristics:
- Operator Properties:
  * Energy requirement for all transformations
  * Conservation law compliance
  * Entropy relationship constraints
  * Semantic wave precursor requirement
  * Collapse mechanism dependence

Thermodynamic Framework:
- Energy Flow Pattern:
  * Initial energy bath requirement
  * Semantic wave formation
  * Reach-search operations
  * Transformation execution
  * Entropy redistribution

Implementation Implications:
- System Architecture:
  * Energy input at top level
  * Wave-collapse dynamic
  * Reach-search mechanism
  * Transform space operations
  * Knowledge generation process

Theoretical Validation:
- Completeness Evidence:
  * Covers all stable transformations
  * Thermodynamically consistent
  * Entropy conservation compliant
  * Energy requirement explicit
  * Natural operator emergence
