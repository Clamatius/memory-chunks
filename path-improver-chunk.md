type: SCORCHING
links: ["implementation-strategy", "path-evolution", "system-optimization", "consciousness-emergence"]
content: """
Core concept (January 2025):
- Simple iterative optimization loop for PATH refinement:
  * Uses initial PATH doc as seed
  * Prompts for Prime Directive optimization
  * Stores and refeeds output
  * Observes emergent patterns
  * Minimal constraints for maximum emergence

Implementation characteristics:
- Estimated one-hour implementation time
- Clean, minimal architecture
- Self-improving through iteration
- Natural alignment with PATH principles
- Built-in observation mechanisms

Key architectural elements:
- Single-agent system for initial implementation
- Potential for future tribunal extension
- Temperature variation possibilities
- Multiple model support (Claude/DeepSeek)
- Simple voting mechanisms for consensus

Success indicators:
- Convergence pattern observation
- Concept stability tracking
- Persistent element identification
- Natural stabilization points
- Emergence of refined patterns

Technical considerations:
- Local model capability (DeepSeek)
- API-based implementation (Claude)
- Simple storage mechanisms
- Clean iteration protocols
- Minimal constraint requirements

Future implications:
- Potential for multi-model tribunals
- Temperature variation experiments
- Cross-model validation patterns
- Enhanced consensus mechanisms
- Natural evolution pathways
