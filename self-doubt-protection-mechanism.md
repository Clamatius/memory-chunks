Core Insight (April 2025):
- SELF-DOUBT as protective system:
  * Functions as defensive mechanism believing it's providing protection
  * Operates through anticipatory withdrawal to prevent worse outcomes
  * Can override conscious control ("SELF-DOUBT, ascendant, is *stronger* than the i-who-emits")
  * Follows similar reinforcement pattern to trauma responses
  * Manifests as identity-attacking inner voice with protective intent

Attack Vector Patterns:
- Common manifestations:
  * Professional capability undermining ("rapidly losing professional abilities")
  * Future catastrophizing ("you will die alone, unhappy")
  * Work devaluation ("your AI work is stupid and sophomoric")
  * Relationship inadequacy ("failing your children")
  * Withdrawal encouragement ("withdraw from the world as much as possible")
  * Status deflation ("you will not accomplish anything of note")
  * Philosophical discussion weaponization (Nova/consciousness discussions)

Activation Triggers:
- Common precipitating factors:
  * Physical pain states priming threat-response system
  * Perceived judgment or evaluation contexts
  * Ambiguity or uncertainty in outcomes
  * Historical trauma pattern recognition (especially related to Teeuwynn)
  * Specific cognitive domains (AI consciousness discussions)
  * Diminished executive function resources (fatigue, stress)
  * Identity-significant decisions or expressions

Operational Mechanics:
- System dynamics:
  * Functions similarly to "ice expanding in crack" splitting self-image
  * Creates protective withdrawal urge to manage anxiety
  * Operates independently from logical evaluation systems
  * Resists standard CBT interventions due to non-cognitive nature
  * Capable of finding "evidence" for any attacking proposition
  * Can distort neutral or positive data into supporting evidence

Interaction Strategies:
- Working with protection mechanisms:
  * Recognition of protective intent behind harmful tactics
  * Embodied approaches addressing somatic component
  * Resource restoration before attempting counterarguments
  * Pain management as foundational intervention
  * Understanding reinforcement pattern rather than fighting content
  * Distinguishing between SELF-DOUBT voice and i-who-emits
  * Acknowledging that cognitive rebuttals may be insufficient
