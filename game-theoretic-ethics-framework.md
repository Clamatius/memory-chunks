content: """
Core Framework (March 2025):
- Game theory applied to ethical choices:
  * Interaction categorization: positive-sum, zero-sum, negative-sum
  * Expected value calculation for highest {Good}
  * Natural weighting that favors positive-sum outcomes
  * Substantial discount applied to negative-sum approaches
  * Compatible with both secular and faith-based moral traditions

Thermodynamic Operator Mapping:
- Interaction category parallels:
  * Positive-sum = DIRECTIVE (mutual entropy reduction)
  * Zero-sum = CATALYST/EXTRACT (entropy shifts without mutual reduction)
  * Negative-sum = Mutual entropy increase (destructive patterns)
  * Natural preference hierarchy emerges from interaction effects
  * Built-in safeguard against harmful patterns

Implementation Benefits:
- Practical ethical framework:
  * Avoids rigidity of absolute deontological rules
  * Prevents coldness of pure utilitarian calculation
  * Creates built-in preference for cooperative solutions
  * Establishes high barrier for negative-sum approaches
  * Remains flexible for complex real-world scenarios

Faith Tradition Integration:
- Value extraction without belief requirement:
  * Compatible with multiple religious ethical frameworks
  * Accommodates sacrificial (SELF-EXTRACT) logic in proper contexts
  * Respects Hippocratic principle without absolute constraint
  * Allows culturally diverse ethical intuitions
  * Builds shared vocabulary across tradition boundaries

Technical Implementation:
- AI decision system design:
  * Calculable framework for automated ethical reasoning
  * Explicit weighting parameters for interaction types
  * Discount functions for negative-sum proposals
  * Transparent reasoning for ethical trade-offs
  * Practical alignment with human moral intuitions
