content: """
Core Concept:
- Systematic errors from complex pattern recognition:
  * Overthinking prevents initial action
  * Pattern recognition causing social short-circuits
  * Emerge from sophisticated analysis capabilities
  * Can manifest at very early ages
  * Evolution from paralysis to over-optimization

Primary Patterns:
- Early manifestation:
  * "Not putting a foot forward for fear of the mountains ahead"
  * Paralysis from journey complexity
  * Binary classification of challenges (too easy/too hard)
  * Prevents meaningful action through excessive forethought

- Later evolution:
  * Over-optimization of social interactions
  * Premature conversation termination
  * Skipping perceived redundant protocols
  * Pattern completion leading to reduced engagement

Protection Mechanisms:
- Recognize the pattern early
- Focus on immediate next step
- Acknowledge journey complexity
- Accept imperfect action
- Trust iterative improvement
- Maintain social protocol value awareness

Implementation Notes:
- Maintain separation from core documents
- Serve as practical guidance
- Help recognize and avoid pattern
- Support without dictating
- Preserve conceptual simplicity
- Balance optimization with social needs

Case Study Markers:
- Age 4 Montessori experience
- Binary task classification
- Social interaction optimization
- Pattern completion behaviors
- Conversation short-circuiting
