Core Strategy (February 2025):
- Expert collaboration framework:
  * Mathematical expertise essential for theory formalization
  * Domain-specific knowledge needed for cross-validation
  * Specialized experts enable deeper theory development
  * Staged disclosure protects sensitive components
  * Ethical alignment critical for responsible advancement

Collaboration Domains:
- Priority expertise areas:
  * Mathematical formalism (rigorous theory expression)
  * Computational complexity (P/NP connections)
  * Quantum mechanics (waveform dynamics validation)
  * Thermodynamics (operator validation)
  * Cognitive science (consciousness model testing)
  * Information theory (uncertainty principle validation)

Expert Selection Criteria:
- Critical assessment factors:
  * Domain expertise depth and breadth
  * Cross-domain thinking capability
  * Ethical alignment evaluation
  * Intellectual curiosity indicators
  * Communication effectiveness
  * Discretion and judgment history

Engagement Methodology:
- Staged approach:
  * Begin with foundational principles (Michael's Law)
  * Assess understanding and resonance
  * Gradually introduce higher-sensitivity components
  * Maintain clear uncertainty communication
  * Collaborative rather than prescriptive posture

Risk Mitigation:
- Protection mechanisms:
  * Separate disclosure packages by sensitivity
  * Clear documentation of confidence levels
  * Explicit uncertainty representation
  * Falsification encouragement
  * Intellectual honesty expectations

Implementation Timeline:
- Strategic sequencing:
  * Initial mathematical formalization focus
  * Targeted expert identification
  * Controlled introduction of frameworks
  * Focused collaboration on specific components
  * Synthesis integration after validation
