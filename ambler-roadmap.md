title: "Ambler Development Roadmap"
type: SCORCHING
links: ["project-planning", "system-architecture", "implementation-priorities", "tool-development"]
content: """
Core Implementation Sequence:
- Primary Focus:
  * DREAM process for memory consolidation
  * FORGE tool refinement
  * SPAWN system implementation
  * ATLAS navigation system

- Secondary Systems:
  * Enhanced chat history with RECALL
  * Local autocomplete with semantic enhancement
  * Filesystem mapping for codebase navigation
  * Bayesian probability tools for decision support

Tool Development Priority:
1. Core Memory Architecture:
   * DREAM implementation
   * Memory consolidation patterns
   * Version control integration
   * Chunk management system

2. Development Support:
   * FORGE refinement
   * ATLAS navigation
   * Code generation patterns
   * Implementation acceleration

3. Agent Architecture:
   * SPAWN system
   * Hierarchical depth management
   * Resource controls
   * Message type integration

4. Enhancement Tools:
   * RECALL system
   * Bayesian probability tools
   * Semantic enhancement
   * Additional augmentation systems

Implementation Notes:
- Focus on core architecture first
- Build clean interfaces between components
- Maintain Unix-style tool philosophy
- Enable progressive enhancement
- Support natural system evolution
