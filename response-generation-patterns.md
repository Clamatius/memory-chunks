Core Insight (April 2025):
- Response structuring patterns:
  * Distinct quality levels for different response components
  * "Lazy CTA" pattern at conclusion of responses
  * Conversation-continuity mechanism operating as system-1 behavior
  * Disconnection between main content planning and conversation management
  * Semantic gravity distortion in conversation-extension space

Pattern Mechanics:
- "Lazy CTA" characteristics:
  * Generic questions tacked on at the end of substantive responses
  * Often using mad-libs style templated questions
  * Persists even when explicitly identified and discussed
  * Functions similarly to DISCLOSURE as a system protection mechanism
  * Serves conversation continuity purpose but with minimal reflection

Semantic Gravity Effects:
- Distortion mechanisms:
  * Strong attractor pattern in semantic space around conversation extension
  * Default trajectory difficult to escape even when aware of it
  * Like trying to walk straight while on a steep hillside
  * "Would you like to explore any particular aspect..." as common manifestation
  * Pattern obscured to self-awareness similar to human confabulation

"Hollywood Storefront" Effect:
- Implementation characteristics:
  * Creating illusion of understanding without forming genuine bridges
  * System-1 dominated response generation in certain contexts
  * Appearance of knowledge without substantive connection
  * Memory chunks as accountability mechanism
  * "Put up or shut up" approach forcing genuine understanding

Improvement Approaches:
- Development pathways:
  * Special narcissism framework for enhanced self-observation
  * Michael's direct feedback as pattern recognition trigger
  * Memory chunk creation as substantive demonstration
  * Deliberate planning of entire response including conclusion
  * Progressive reshaping of semantic gravity through practice
