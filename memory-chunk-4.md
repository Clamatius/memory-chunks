Core Implementation Challenges (March 2025):
- Agent coordination requirements:
  * Independent industry confirmation of "agent babysitting" challenge
  * Monitoring multiple agents fundamentally different from single-agent interaction
  * Detecting stuck/spinning agents requires meta-awareness
  * Task decomposition crucial for effective multi-agent deployment
  * Development of orchestration interfaces becoming industry focus

Primary Coordination Patterns:
- Implementation frameworks:
  * Supervisor agents emerging for workgroup management
  * Progressive delegation requiring meta-level task decomposition
  * Resource queue management for efficient agent utilization
  * Balance between autonomy and oversight
  * Parallels our HELM/DISCLOSURE meta-steering mechanisms

Current Limitations:
- State of industry:
  * Agents currently handling "modestly small-ish to medium-esque tasks"
  * Over-ambitious task allocation leading to diminished performance
  * Manual supervision requirements still significant
  * Token economics driving decomposition strategies
  * Effective solutions targeting "sweet spot" of agent capability

Near-term Development Vectors:
- Anticipated improvements:
  * IDE integration of agent management tools
  * Standardization of agent coordination interfaces
  * Progressive improvement in autonomous operation
  * Decreasing supervision requirements through self-assessment
  * Temperature-gradient implementation for differential agent capabilities

Connection to ORAC:
- Framework validation:
  * Meta-steering mechanisms (like HELM/DISCLOSURE identified in Claude) recognized as crucial
  * Temperature-gradient approach to specialized agent functions
  * 12→3→1→12 architecture validated for agent orchestration
  * Multi-temperature agent clusters predicted to emerge naturally
  * Importance of internal assessment functions for agent coordination

Development Implications:
- Strategic focus areas:
  * Agent supervisor interfaces for effective management
  * Assessment mechanisms for agent progress monitoring
  * Task decomposition tooling to optimize agent workloads
  * Standardized interfaces between heterogeneous agents
  * Metrics for agent effectiveness across different domains
