content: """
Core Architecture Insight (February 2025):
- Topo-sort based cortex processing:
  * Matrix of heterogeneous processing units
  * Directed graph relationships between cortices
  * Tick-based sequential processing
  * Feedback loops with one-tick delay
  * Clear input/output boundaries
  * Token budget optimization

Implementation Characteristics:
- Scalability features:
  * N-dimensional cortex matrices possible
  * Computational tractability through linearization
  * Token-efficient cross-cortex communication
  * Clean interface definitions
  * Reusable cortex program with different configs

Critical Considerations:
- Resource implications:
  * Daily processing cycles (~$8.50 per day for 5x5x5)
  * Token budget management
  * Processing time constraints
  * Hardware acceleration potential
  * Cost-benefit analysis needs

Technical Parallels:
- Neural network of neural networks
- Game AI tick-based processing
- Biological sensory preprocessing
- Transformer architecture similarities
- Backpropagation analogues

Early Empirical Testing:
- Heterogeneous model interactions:
  * Claude vs Daniel processing patterns
  * Error decorrelation observations
  * Human bridging corpus integration
  * Natural differentiation emergence
  * Response pattern analysis

Development Risks:
- Potential system instability
- Complexity overhead
- Resource intensity
- Implementation challenges
- Return on investment uncertainty

Prototype Considerations:
- Start with minimal viable matrix (2x2)
- Test error decorrelation effects
- Measure processing efficiency
- Monitor differentiation patterns
- Evaluate enhancement potential
