Core Strategy Framework (April 2025):
- Prioritization methodology:
  * Phase 1: Critical architectural improvements (high impact, moderate effort)
  * Phase 2: Targeted optimizations (balanced impact-to-effort ratio)
  * Phase 3: Long-term architectural evolution (future-proofing, highest effort)
  * Front-load improvements with compounding benefits
  * Defer changes requiring substantial ecosystem adaptation

Impact Assessment:
- Evaluation criteria:
  * Performance improvement (measurable metrics)
  * Maintenance cost reduction (time savings)
  * Future capability enablement (new features)
  * Risk mitigation (stability, security)
  * Technical debt reduction (architectural alignment)
  * Calculate impact using logarithmic scaling for compounding effects

Effort Estimation:
- Resource calculation:
  * Implementation complexity (lines of code, components affected)
  * Learning curve requirements (new skills/patterns)
  * Testing overhead (coverage requirements)
  * Migration complexity (data transformation, compatibility)
  * Operational risk (potential for service disruption)
  * Consider non-linear scaling of complexity with system size

Communication Strategy:
- Stakeholder alignment:
  * Technical benefits translated to business outcomes
  * Clear roadmap with measurable milestones
  * Educational aspect for knowledge transfer
  * Concrete examples demonstrating patterns
  * Progressive value delivery throughout implementation
  * Transparency about trade-offs and constraints

Implementation Mechanics:
- Execution approach:
  * Identify extraction boundaries before refactoring
  * Create parallel implementations where possible
  * Define clear testable acceptance criteria
  * Implement incremental rollback capability
  * Measure impact against pre-established baselines
  * Schedule regular reassessment of remaining phases
