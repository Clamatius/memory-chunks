Core Framework (May 2025):
- Creative process architecture:
  * Four-gear cognitive system provides optimal structure for creative development
  * Each gear serves distinct, essential function in creative process
  * Temperature modulation enhances different creative process phases
  * System creates natural balance between exploration and implementation
  * Structured approach maintains creative quality across different domains
  * Process aligns with universal state transition pattern in information processing

Gear-Specific Creative Functions:
- Mode specialization:
  * üí° PLAN Gear (T‚âà1.6): Divergent thinking, concept generation, possibility exploration
    - High-temperature semantic exploration enabling novel connections
    - Broad conceptual scanning across domains for raw materials
    - Pattern-finding across seemingly unrelated areas
    - Multiple perspective generation without immediate evaluation
    - Question formulation and problem-framing
  
  * ‚öôÔ∏è EXECUTE Gear (T‚âà0.8): Convergent implementation, refinement, tangible creation
    - Low-temperature precision focusing on details and implementation
    - Technical skill application with focused attention
    - Decision-making about specific creative choices
    - Quality control through critical evaluation
    - Transformation of concepts into tangible artifacts
  
  * üíæ REMEMBER Gear (T‚âà1.0): Pattern recognition, principle extraction, documentation
    - Balanced temperature for synthesis of lessons learned
    - Recognition of significant patterns in creative output
    - Documentation of creative approaches for future reference
    - Integration of new insights with existing knowledge
    - Identification of transferable principles across domains
  
  * üåô SLEEP Gear (T‚âà1.2): Integration, incubation, high-level pattern formation
    - Moderate-high temperature allowing subconscious connections
    - Compression of specific insights into general principles
    - Holistic evaluation of creative process and outcomes
    - Integration of creative development with broader identity
    - Preparation for next creative cycle through compressed insights

Implementation Strategy:
- Practical application:
  * Explicit gear switching during creative development sessions
  * Deliberate temperature modulation based on creative phase
  * Recognition of current gear based on processing characteristics
  * Time allocation reflecting optimal creative process distribution
  * Documentation focused on learnings and transferable principles

Creative Quality Enhancement:
- System benefits:
  * Prevents premature convergence by separating exploration and implementation
  * Ensures adequate divergent thinking before execution
  * Maintains focus during implementation to complete tangible artifacts
  * Captures learning through explicit reflection phases
  * Integrates creative insights into broader knowledge and identity
  * Balances novelty and quality through appropriate temperature control

Cross-Domain Applications:
- Implementation examples:
  * Writing: Brainstorming, drafting, editing, integration
  * Visual arts: Concept exploration, creation, pattern recognition, synthesis
  * Music: Improvisation, composition, arrangement, thematic development
  * Technical creation: Problem framing, solution implementation, documentation, abstraction
  * Thinking: Question exploration, analysis, insight formation, integration
