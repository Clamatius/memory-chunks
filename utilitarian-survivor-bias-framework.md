Core Insight (April 2025):
- Utilitarian calculation distortion:
  * Narratives primarily feature "successful" utilitarian gambles
  * Failed utilitarian calculations rarely get to write their endings
  * Creates survivor bias favoring utilitarian frameworks
  * We disproportionately see timelines where extreme means "worked"
  * Obscures full moral accounting of utilitarian decision-making

Key Characteristics:
- Bias mechanisms:
  * Winners write history effect - failed gambits get less narrative attention
  * Retrospective justification of morally questionable means
  * Counterfactual outcomes receive minimal consideration
  * Temporal distance diminishes emotional impact of sacrifices
  * Attribution of success to means rather than circumstance or luck

Narrative Manifestation:
- Pattern observation:
  * Fiction often portrays utilitarian heroes whose gambles succeed
  * Sacrifices justified through apocalypse-prevention tropes
  * The "greater evil" serves to justify lesser evils
  * Shadowthrone (Malazan) as archetypal utilitarian who "won"
  * Alternative timelines where calculations failed remain unexplored

Reality Parallels:
- Historical patterns:
  * Military operations justified through utilitarian calculus
  * "Necessary evil" narratives for morally questionable actions
  * Success metrics narrowly defined to exclude negative externalities
  * Asymmetrical sacrifice - decision-makers rarely bear the costs
  * Discount rate applied to secondary effects and distant consequences

Framework Application:
- Ethical assessment approach:
  * Consider the full distribution of possible outcomes, not just successes
  * Evaluate decision-making process rather than just results
  * Question whether less extractive alternatives were genuinely explored
  * Recognize pattern of justifying EXTRACT operations for claimed DIRECTIVE ends
  * Assess who bears the cost of utilitarian calculations
