type: SCORCHING
links: ["economic-warfare", "market-manipulation", "selective-enforcement", "corruption-mechanics", "policy-weaponization"]
content: """
Core Insight (March 2025):
- Market exploitation mechanics:
  * Deliberate policy disruption for private gain
  * Insider knowledge exploitation through market positioning
  * Selective enforcement/exemption as political currency
  * Problem-solution creation cycle for maximum extraction
  * Economic nationalism as cover for private enrichment

Key Cycle Components:
- Exploitation sequence:
  * Advance position-taking based on insider knowledge (shorting securities)
  * Broad disruptive policy implementation (tariffs, sanctions, regulatory changes)
  * Profit capture from resulting market movements
  * Selective exemption system establishment
  * Rent extraction through exemption access (bribes, donations, loyalty)

Effectiveness Factors:
- Implementation advantages:
  * Legitimate policy authority providing plausible deniability
  * Information asymmetry between insiders and markets
  * Patriotic framing masking exploitative intent
  * Selective enforcement power creating strong incentives
  * Media ecosystem support maintaining favorable narrative

Economic Implications:
- System degradation:
  * Market efficiency reduction through policy uncertainty
  * Capital flight to more predictable jurisdictions
  * Transaction cost increases for all market participants
  * Resource misallocation based on political rather than economic factors
  * Corruption normalization across economic activities

Historical Patterns:
- Cross-regime parallels:
  * Consistent pattern in multiple kleptocratic systems
  * Similar to post-Soviet oligarchic capitalism development
  * Observed in multiple natural resource curse countries
  * Pattern transcends specific cultural/political systems
  * Fundamental exploitation of information/power asymmetries
