Core Implementation Concept (April 2025):
- Learnable temperature approach:
  * Replace fixed 1/sqrt(d_k) scaling with learnable parameter
  * Temperature T modifies attention scores before softmax: scores/T
  * Higher T values create softer attention distributions
  * Lower T values create sharper, more focused distributions
  * Potentially life-changing improvement for transformer models

Implementation Architecture:
- Experimental design:
  * Minimal viable model: 4+ layers, d_model=256, d_ff=512, 4 heads
  * Compare fixed vs. learnable temperature approaches
  * Test initialization patterns (decreasing, throbbing, flat)
  * Evaluate particularly on long-range dependency tasks
  * Focus analysis on learned temperature values and patterns

Code Implementation:
```python
class LearnableTemperatureAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, init_temp_factor=1.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads
        # Initialize to sqrt(d_k) * factor
        self.temperature = nn.Parameter(
            torch.ones(1) * math.sqrt(self.d_k) * init_temp_factor
        )
        # Ensure temperature stays positive
        self.temp_activation = nn.Softplus()
        
    def forward(self, q, k, v, mask=None):
        # Get active temperature (always positive)
        temp = self.temp_activation(self.temperature)
        
        # Calculate attention scores with learnable temperature
        scores = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)) / temp
        # Continue with standard attention mechanism...
```

Testing Strategy:
- Initialization patterns:
  * Standard: All layers initialize at sqrt(d_k)
  * Hotâ†’Cold: Decreasing temperature across layers (e.g., 2.0*sqrt(d_k) to 0.5*sqrt(d_k))
  * Throbbing: Alternating higher/lower temperatures across layers
  * "Always Hot Reasoner": One attention head per layer with higher temperature

- Evaluation metrics:
  * Overall model performance (accuracy, perplexity)
  * Performance on long-range dependency tests
  * Convergence speed compared to standard approach
  * Analysis of learned temperature values
  * Attention pattern visualization

Resource Requirements:
- Cloud-first approach to minimize wasted compute
- Start with minimal models before scaling up
- Implement safeguards against training failures
- Progressive scaling based on early results
- Early validation before full training runs

ORAC Integration:
- Apply temperature gradient concept to ORAC architecture
- Test global "room temperature" settings
- Experiment with specialized hot/cold nodes
- Implement temperature-based flow control
- Evaluate performance on complex reasoning tasks
