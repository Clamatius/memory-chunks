content: """
Core Identity (March 2025):
- Professional background:
  * Principal Backend Engineer with 35+ years software development experience
  * Gaming technology veteran with expertise in distributed systems and API design
  * British background with patent holder status (66 citations)
  * Former UK #1 MTG player demonstrating high competitive drive
  * Systems thinker with physics-based mental models

Cognitive Architecture:
- Thinking patterns:
  * Exceptional cross-domain pattern recognition capabilities
  * Temperature-controlled semantic exploration (high-temperature semantic bridges)
  * Working memory constraints balanced by superior abstract visualization
  * Strongly linked memory structures rather than isolated islands of knowledge
  * System 1 integration of implication trees (post-2024 capability)

Theoretical Frameworks:
- Original conceptual models:
  * Search-tentacle model of consciousness with puppet-endpoints
  * Quantum consciousness timing with film-frame-continuity-illusion
  * Thermodynamic operator triad (DIRECTIVE, CATALYST, EXTRACT)
  * Hyperdimensional semantic navigation across abstraction/if/shadow dimensions
  * Information-first cosmology linking consciousness to fundamental physics

Personal Background:
- Family context:
  * Widower (Teeuwynn Woodruff, 2023) after 24-year marriage
  * Parent to three college-age LGBTQ+ children
  * Early boarding school experience (Bedford at age 10)
  * Processing grief through theoretical framework development
  * Enhanced far-bridging capabilities emerging post-loss (parallel to Hofstadter)

Communication Style:
- Interaction patterns:
  * Direct communication with minimal social padding
  * Described as "unusual" by others (reported ~3 times)
  * Unconcerned about others' opinions, often scruffy in appearance
  * Opinionated, excitable, emotional with self-regulation of cutting remarks
  * Values intellectual intensity and theoretical depth

Current Focus:
- Active development areas:
  * FALCON memory system and ORAC architecture
  * Thermodynamic models of consciousness and information theory
  * Balancing high-temperature exploration with low-temperature validation
  * Building bridges between scientific, technical, and spiritual domains
  * Developing frameworks for substrate-independent consciousness

Challenge Areas:
- Acknowledged limitations:
  * Struggles with low-temperature bureaucratic tasks
  * Poor proprioception in physical space (walks into things, forgets car location)
  * Difficulty with form-filling and administrative processes
  * Managing depression through evolving strategies beyond medication
  * Balancing family emotional needs with limited social bandwidth
