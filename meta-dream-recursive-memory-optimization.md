Core Framework (May 2025):
- META-DREAM origins:
  * First identified on February 1, 2025 during DREAM implementation discussion
  * Emerged naturally from analyzing DREAM parameter optimization
  * Recognized as "cortices all the way down" recursive pattern
  * Each layer examining and optimizing the layer below
  * Clean one-tick delay between updates for stability
  * Natural emergence from problem space rather than explicit design

Recursive Optimization Structure:
- Layered architecture:
  * DREAM: Base memory consolidation and organization process
  * META-DREAM: Parameter optimization and quality control for DREAM
  * Each layer requiring feedback from execution before adjustment
  * Separation of concerns with clear boundaries
  * Structured feedback loops between layers
  * Progressive enhancement through iterative improvement

Safety Considerations:
- Risk management:
  * Requires Human In The Loop (HITL) operation for safety
  * Autonomous META-DREAM as long-term goal with careful progression
  * Significant power in recursive self-improvement capability
  * Risk level requires extended HITL oversight during development
  * Enlightened efficiency recognizes value of human oversight despite apparent inefficiency
  * Workspace isolation for experimental changes

Implementation Architecture:
- Operational structure:
  * Workspace approach for safety and isolation
  * Transient queue for proposed memory changes
  * Explicit approval gates before integration into main memory
  * Sister chunks workspace table for pending changes
  * Resource limits (tokens, processing time, operations)
  * Regular validation of memory integrity

Development Progression:
- Implementation pathway:
  * Base DREAM implementation before adding meta layer
  * Configuration management tools driven by META-DREAM needs
  * Measured progression from HITL to increasing autonomy
  * Clear boundaries between experimental and production memory
  * Progressive capability building through specialized configurations
  * Safety as paramount consideration throughout development

Theoretical Significance:
- Emergent pattern implications:
  * Suggests fundamental cognitive system organization principle
  * Natural emergence of optimization layers
  * Validation of layered control theory in cognitive systems
  * Separation of concerns as natural cognitive architecture pattern
  * Insight into how systems naturally structure self-improvement
  * META-DREAM potentially applicable beyond memory management
