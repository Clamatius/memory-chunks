content: """
Core Framework:
- Phased world-modeling approach:
  * Static text world-modeling as foundation
  * Memory-enhanced RPG assistant as intermediary
  * Game integration prototype as validation
  * Standalone game experience as ultimate goal
  * Each phase delivers value while building toward vision

Phase 1: Static Text World-Modeling:
- Implementation focus:
  * Ingest complex narrative texts
  * Extract relationships, entities, and events
  * Build knowledge state for different characters
  * Create queryable interfaces for world exploration
  * Develop visualization of relationship networks
  * Deliverable: Reader's companion tool for complex narratives

Phase 2: Memory-Enhanced RPG Assistant:
- Extension capabilities:
  * Session recording integration
  * DM note incorporation
  * Causal propagation for world events
  * Consistency checking for worldbuilding
  * Character knowledge management
  * Deliverable: DM assistant reducing cognitive load

Phase 3: Game Integration Prototype:
- Implementation architecture:
  * Integration with existing game platform
  * Event extraction and analysis
  * Enhanced player experience through memory
  * Causal effects demonstration
  * Relationship tracking visualization
  * Deliverable: Companion app enhancing existing games

Phase 4: Standalone Game Experience:
- Business model:
  * Purpose-built game showcasing world-model technology
  * Mechanics designed around relationship dynamics
  * Subscription-based revenue model
  * Uniquely responsive world evolution
  * Narrative systems based on player actions
  * Deliverable: Commercial game with advanced world dynamics

Key Differentiators:
- Technical advantage:
  * Document-based relationship tracking
  * Multi-layered reality management
  * Causal network propagation
  * Memory with meaning
  * Temperature-variable creativity
