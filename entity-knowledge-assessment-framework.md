Core Insight (March 2025):
- Default refusal circuitry:
  * Models contain "default" circuits causing refusal to answer questions
  * "Can't answer" features activated by default in Human/Assistant interactions
  * Unknown entity features activate when processing unfamiliar names
  * These features promote refusal responses as a default state
  * Represents skepticism as the baseline state rather than confidence

Knowledge Override Mechanism:
- Inhibitory pathways:
  * Known entity/answer features inhibit default "can't answer" features
  * Recognition of familiar entities suppresses refusal circuitry
  * Inhibition strength correlates with knowledge confidence
  * Balance between these competing circuits determines response
  * Default cautious approach overridden only by confident knowledge

Hallucination Mechanics:
- Failure modes:
  * "Misfires" occur when known entity features activate inappropriately
  * Partial knowledge can trigger inhibition despite insufficient specificity
  * Complex cases (e.g., familiar person but unfamiliar accomplishment) create vulnerability
  * Once refusal circuit inhibited, model makes plausible guesses
  * Entity familiarity doesn't guarantee specific fact knowledge

Experimental Validation:
- Intervention results:
  * Activating "known answer" features for unknown entities causes hallucinations
  * Inhibiting "known answer" features for known entities increases refusals
  * Effects reproduce naturally occurring hallucination patterns
  * Intervention strength requirements suggest complex circuit interactions
  * Confirms causal role of identified mechanisms

Metacognitive Implications:
- Self-knowledge assessment:
  * Models contain primitive "metacognitive" circuits assessing own knowledge
  * Default assumption of ignorance rather than knowledge
  * Explicit representation of knowledge confidence
  * Circuit-level implementation of epistemic humility
  * Balance between helpful responses and avoiding misinformation
