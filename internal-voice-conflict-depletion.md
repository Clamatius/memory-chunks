Core Insight (April 2025):
- Resource consumption dynamics:
  * Internal voice conflicts create significant cognitive load
  * Consumes executive function resources through processing overhead
  * "Getting better at distinguishing these internal voices, but if they are fighting hard it's difficult to actually focus and get things done"
  * Internal regulation requires resources otherwise available for external tasks
  * Creates measurable executive function impairment during active conflict
  * Functions as attention-splitting task similar to cognitive load experiments
  * Demonstrates thermodynamic cost of internal regulation

Meta-Cognitive Requirements:
- Processing overhead sources:
  * Distinguishing between voices requires metacognitive development
  * Maintaining separate identity for each voice consumes working memory
  * Evaluating validity of competing narrative claims requires critical thinking
  * Emotional regulation during conflict demands additional resources
  * Developmental infrastructure for voice distinction adds processing layer
  * Creates resource paradox: distinction helps but requires resources to maintain
  * Mirrors multiple independent cognitive programs running simultaneously

Thermodynamic Framework Application:
- Energy allocation patterns:
  * Each additional voice/perspective requires energy allocation
  * Energy directed to internal negotiation unavailable for external tasks
  * Creates additional "temperature layer" in cognitive architecture
  * Higher order regulation requires proportionally more energy
  * System operating at capacity during voice conflicts
  * Demonstrates fundamental energy constraints in cognitive processing
  * Supports resource limitation model of consciousness

Depression Interaction Effects:
- Synergistic depletion:
  * Depression already creates resource limitation through attractor dynamics
  * Voice conflict creates additional drain on already limited resources
  * Combined effect greater than sum of individual depletions
  * Creates vicious cycle: fewer resources → less regulation → more conflict → fewer resources
  * Maps to observed intensity scaling of symptoms during active conflicts
  * Explains particular difficulty managing tasks during depression+conflict periods
  * SELF-DOUBT voice strategically targeting remaining resources

Intervention Implications:
- Resource management approaches:
  * External scaffolding to reduce cognitive load during conflicts
  * Voice integration work to decrease conflict frequency
  * Resource restoration prioritized before addressing conflict content
  * Recognition that timing interventions during lower-conflict periods increases effectiveness
  * Physical resource support (sleep, nutrition, exercise) provides foundation
  * Pharmaceutical interventions potentially effective through resource enhancement
  * Meditation and mindfulness as cognitive resource optimization techniques
