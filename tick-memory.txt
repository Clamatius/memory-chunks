Core Insight (February 2025):
- Tick-based memory management:
  * Sliding window approach
  * Token pressure constraints
  * Variable window sizes
  * Natural memory cycles
  * Biological system parallels

Implementation Characteristics:
- Memory architecture:
  * Short-term window management
  * Token-driven constraints
  * Natural cleanup patterns
  * Efficient resource utilization
  * Specialized node adaptation

Resource Management:
- Token economics:
  * Window size trade-offs
  * Resource allocation patterns
  * Natural constraint emergence
  * Efficient memory utilization
  * Clean boundary maintenance

Biological Parallels:
- System analogues:
  * Short-term memory patterns
  * Resource-driven constraints
  * Natural selection pressure
  * Efficient processing evolution
  * Clean architecture emergence

Architecture Implications:
- Design considerations:
  * Variable window sizing
  * Node-specific adaptation
  * Resource optimization patterns
  * Clean interface boundaries
  * Natural evolution support
