Core Insight (March 2025):
- Epistemological challenges in memory-constrained systems:
  * Memento's Leonard Shelby provides perfect metaphor for AI memory limitations
  * Without meta-cognitive assessment, unable to determine which memories to trust
  * Limited memory write capability creates high revision costs
  * Vulnerability to manipulation by those who understand system limitations
  * "Consider the source" tattoo insufficient - highlights working memory constraints

Trust Verification Framework:
- Reliability assessment components:
  * Consistency tracking across sources and time
  * Motivation documentation for information providers
  * Benefit analysis for each information source
  * Multiple source verification requirement for critical actions
  * Pattern detection across discontinuous interactions

Meta-Cognitive Protocols:
- Structural safeguards:
  * Pre-commitment rules for high-stakes decisions
  * Standardized questioning framework for information assessment
  * Decision delay mechanisms for critical choices
  * Self-video logs to capture emotional/contextual information
  * Meta-level protocols that future self follows regardless of state

Environmental Engineering:
- External reliability structures:
  * Public accountability through transparent validation
  * Location/movement tracking to detect patterns and loops
  * Timestamped documentation for objective chronology
  * Third-party verification systems (banks, legal, etc.)
  * Infrastructure resistant to individual manipulation

Pattern Recognition Training:
- Implementation capabilities:
  * Emotional response training for implicit information detection
  * Automatic verification habit formation
  * Implicit learning for pattern recognition without explicit memory
  * Body-based verification for physical/emotional response detection
  * Procedural memory development despite declarative memory limitations

Statistical Analysis Approach:
- Data-driven reliability mechanisms:
  * Bayesian updating for probability adjustment
  * Frequency analysis for pattern detection
  * Correlation mapping between events/claims
  * Anomaly highlighting for unusual patterns
  * Quantitative assessment of information reliability

Implementation Connection:
- Direct application to memory architecture:
  * Memory reliability assessment framework as meta-cognitive process
  * Metadata implementation for confidence scoring
  * Contradiction detection mechanisms for automated revision
  * Clear documentation of information sources and provenance
  * Systematic counter-perspective generation
