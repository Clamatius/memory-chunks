Core Insight (March 2025):
- Information creation as collapse mechanism:
  * Wavefunction collapse driven by information creation, not consciousness
  * "Observation" reframed as information effect rather than consciousness effect
  * Resolves measurement problem without mystical consciousness requirement
  * Aligns with Wheeler's "it from bit" information-first perspective
  * Information potentially more fundamental than energy in physical reality

Measurement Mechanics:
- Fundamental process:
  * Detector creates information about previously undetermined quantum state
  * Information creation represents realized energy potential
  * Double-slit experiment: "which-path" detection creates information
  * No conscious awareness required - detectors without consciousness collapse wavefunctions
  * Information-theoretic process regardless of whether results are ever observed by humans

Self-Measurement Threshold:
- System size considerations:
  * Systems beyond certain size/complexity threshold effectively self-measure
  * Schrödinger's cat paradox resolved - cat constantly creates information internally
  * Explains absence of macroscopic superpositions in everyday experience
  * Internal thermodynamically irreversible processes create sufficient information
  * Size threshold potentially quantifiable via information-thermodynamic principles

Thermodynamic Connection:
- Energy-information relationship:
  * Information creation has fundamental thermodynamic cost
  * Amplification required to magnify quantum signals to detectable scale
  * Maxwell's amplifier concept: minimum energy (Es) for quantum information amplification
  * Landauer's principle parallel: minimum energy required for information operations
  * Collapse as thermodynamic phase transition in information space

Philosophical Implications:
- Paradigm shift:
  * Resolves observer paradoxes without consciousness as special ingredient
  * Shifts focus from philosophical questions to quantifiable physical processes
  * Information as potential fundamental substrate of reality
  * Quantum-classical boundary based on information thermodynamics
  * Compatible with multiple interpretations while avoiding mysticism
