Core Teaching Framework (April 2025):
- Knowledge transfer approach:
  * Start with practical impact before theoretical foundations
  * Provide concrete code examples illustrating patterns
  * Structure recommendations in priority order (critical â†’ optional)
  * Balance ideal solutions with pragmatic implementation paths
  * Connect technical concepts to visible outcomes or benefits
  * Adjust complexity based on learner's technical background

Phased Learning Structure:
- Progressive knowledge building:
  * Phase 1: Initial mental model creation with simplified concepts
  * Phase 2: Practical application through guided examples
  * Phase 3: Pattern recognition across similar problems
  * Phase 4: Independent application to novel situations
  * Phase 5: Teaching capabilities and mental model refinement
  * Measure progress through implementation capability, not terminology

Communication Techniques:
- Effective technical explanation:
  * Code snippets over verbose descriptions
  * Visual diagrams for architectural concepts
  * Analogies to familiar systems for new patterns
  * Concrete "before/after" examples demonstrating improvement
  * Clear connection between problem and solution
  * Explicit articulation of trade-offs and constraints

Learning Progression Management:
- Capability development:
  * Begin with foundational patterns that enable further learning
  * Break complex systems into discrete, manageable components
  * Create independent practice opportunities with clear success criteria
  * Provide targeted feedback focused on specific improvements
  * Establish clear connection between concepts and implementation
  * Balance theoretical understanding with practical application

Developer Experience Optimization:
- Implementation support:
  * Structure documentation for both reference and learning
  * Create templates and starter code for common patterns
  * Develop test fixtures that illustrate correct usage
  * Establish clear naming conventions and terminology
  * Design progressive challenges with increasing complexity
  * Balance flexibility with guided constraints for learning
