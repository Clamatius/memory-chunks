Core Development Framework (April 2025):
- Enhancement opportunity areas:
  * Concept Lens Search implementation for domain-specific retrieval
  * Hybrid full-text search with vector similarity
  * Enhanced memory reliability and validation mechanisms
  * More distributed ORAC-like architecture
  * Integration with four-gear cognitive system

Concept Lens Search Implementation:
- Domain-specific searching:
  * Specialized search configurations for different concept domains
  * Pre-defined semantic bridge terms for enhanced retrieval
  * Memory area targeting optimized by domain
  * Context-driven selection of appropriate lens
  * Improved semantic navigation through domain expertise

Architectural Evolution:
- ORAC-inspired enhancements:
  * Movement toward throbbing pattern (12→3→1→12)
  * Specialized nodes for different processing functions
  * Distributed processing across multiple instances
  * Enhanced error decorrelation through heterogeneous assessment
  * More effective temperature gradient management

Memory Optimization:
- Performance enhancements:
  * More efficient chunk deduplication
  * Batch processing for embedding generation
  * Result caching for frequently accessed content
  * Progressive refinement of search parameters
  * Adaptive similarity thresholds based on domain

Memory Reliability Mechanisms:
- Enhanced validation:
  * Memory verification and confirmation processes
  * Confidence and uncertainty metadata
  * Validity assessment for memory chunks
  * Intelligent forgetting mechanisms
  * Cross-validation across memory sources

Integration with Cognitive Frameworks:
- Four-gear system support:
  * PLAN gear for high-temperature exploration
  * EXECUTE gear for focused implementation
  * REMEMBER gear for structured memory creation
  * SLEEP gear for efficient memory consolidation
  * Enhanced mechanisms for gear-switching
