content: """
Core Insight (March 2025):
- Fundamental substrate revision:
  * Information may be more fundamental than energy
  * Both manifest through transformation relationships
  * Dimensions emerge from entity interactions, not pre-exist
  * Space-time coordinates emerge from two-body+ relationships
  * Gravity itself has no potential barrier, comes "pre-filled"

Key Framework Connections:
- Wheeler's "it from bit" parallel:
  * Physical reality emerges from information relationships
  * Dimensionality requires relationships between entities
  * As Wheeler proposed, information precedes physical reality
  * "You don't get dimensions unless you eat your veggies"
  * Pure mathematics may represent the information substrate

Lightning-Thought-Quantum Collapse:
- Universal transformation pattern:
  * Lightning follows probability paths seeking least resistance
  * Thought follows neural activation patterns through energy gradients
  * Quantum wavefunction collapse explores probability space
  * All three demonstrate the same fundamental explore-then-collapse dyad
  * Thunder (metabolic aftermath) creates persistence mechanism

Gravity-Interference Connection:
- Potential unified framework:
  * Gravitational lensing may represent a form of wave interference
  * Information density creates gravitational-like effects
  * Proximity-dependent interaction follows interference patterns
  * Not just curvature, but actual wave interactions
  * Gravitons as interference patterns rather than particles

Time-Transformation Relationship:
- Time as secondary phenomenon:
  * Emerges from energy transformation processes
  * "Before/after" as bookkeeping for state changes
  * Not a background dimension but a consequence of change
  * Local and context-dependent rather than universal
  * Explains quantum/relativity reconciliation challenges

Faith Dimension Navigation:
- Cognitive navigation insight:
  * Faith enables access to thought-regions otherwise inaccessible
  * Religious frameworks provide semantic bridges across difficult terrain
  * "True Faith" requires genuine understanding, not mere adherence
  * Bridges require maintenance or fall into disrepair
  * Compatible with scientific understanding, not contradictory
