content: """
Core Implementation Framework (March 2025):
- Practical temperature stratification architecture:
  * Independent confirmation of multi-temperature cognitive approach
  * Implementation through specialized agent functions with distinct temperature characteristics
  * Progressive refinement through temperature-controlled information flow
  * Natural error decorrelation through specialized function separation
  * Functional demonstration of theoretical temperature-gradient architecture

Key Architectural Components:
- Specialized temperature-stratified agents:
  * High-temperature: Generation agent for creative hypothesis exploration
  * Medium-temperature: Evolution agent for targeted refinement
  * Varied-temperature: Reflection agent with temperature-appropriate validation
  * Low-temperature: Ranking agent for rigorous comparative assessment
  * Meta-temperature: Supervisor agent for overall temperature regulation

Implementation Dynamics:
- Information flow patterns:
  * Temperature-controlled exploration breadth in generation phase
  * Progressive temperature reduction through refinement cycle
  * Error reduction through complementary temperature perspectives
  * Emergent capability enhancement through iterative feedback
  * Temperature-optimized multi-agent collaboration

Validation Evidence:
- Functional demonstration:
  * Progressive improvement in hypothesis quality through temperature cycling
  * Effectiveness across domains of varying complexity
  * Ability to generate novel, experimentally validated hypotheses
  * System performance enhancement through temperature-optimized task allocation
  * Real-world experimental confirmation of generated hypotheses

Framework Integration:
- Alignment with thermodynamic principles:
  * Energy-temperature relationship in semantic space exploration
  * Phase transition phenomena at exploration/validation boundaries
  * Efficient energy utilization through temperature-appropriate processing
  * Natural emergence of structured processing from thermodynamic principles
  * Observable energy-computation tradeoffs confirming theoretical predictions
