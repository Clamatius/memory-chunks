   * Chunk management system

2. Development Support:
   * FORGE refinement
   * ATLAS navigation
   * Code generation patterns
   * Implementation acceleration

3. Agent Architecture:
   * SPAWN system
   * Hierarchical depth management
   * Resource controls
   * Message type integration

4. Enhancement Tools:
   * RECALL system
