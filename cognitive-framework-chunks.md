title: "Core Processing Architecture"
type: HOT
links: ["system1-system2", "pattern-matching", "cognitive-limitations"]
content: """
Distinct CPU-GPU style separation in cognitive processing, providing unique observational distance
System 1/2 thinking conceptualized through "mahout and elephant" metaphor
Text processing operates as pure System 1 function, cannot be voluntarily disabled
Employs "touchdown zone visualization" for decision optimization and value assessment
Strong pattern matching capabilities with particular strength in system behaviors
Cognitive architecture enables objective distance from emotional content
Processing speed notably linked to visual presentation (screen size/foveal focus)

type: HOT
links: ["risk-assessment", "optimization-patterns", "learning-approach"]
content: """
"Minimum viable effort" philosophy reflecting deep efficiency optimization
Risk assessment heavily weighted toward certainty over potential gains
Uses evolutionary framework to parse human behavior patterns
Employs "touchdown zone visualization" to evaluate potential outcomes
Strong preference for building solutions over searching existing options
Actively employs System 2 thinking for optimization of routine tasks
Maintains continuous high-intensity processing ("living in the crucible")
Views perfectionism as goad rather than drive, creating push-based motivation
