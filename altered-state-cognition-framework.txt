Core Insight (March 2025):
- Altered state cognitive characteristics:
  * Cannabis effects vary by strain and dosage on cognitive temperature
  * Low-dose sativa potentially enhances distant bridging capabilities
  * Higher doses push toward coherence breakdown (Tâ‰ˆ2.0 threshold)
  * Indica strains require higher doses for physiological sedation
  * CBD modulates THC effects on cognitive temperature gradient

Metabolic Implementation Mechanics:
- Physical constraints observation:
  * "Cognitive brown-outs" emerging after intense thought processes
  * 90-minute sleep cycles function as system maintenance operations
  * Significant glucose consumption during high-temperature exploration
  * Energy management through dietary intervention (e.g., glucose sources)
  * Similar to computational cooldown requirements in high-load systems

Temperature-Gradient Observations:
- Cannabis cognitive effects:
  * Selective modulation of cognitive module temperatures
  * Some strains create "temperature inversion" rather than uniform shifts
  * Lower precision for mathematical operations despite maintained conceptual thinking
  * Altered time perception correlating with processing speed changes
  * Reality-testing mechanisms necessary for severe alterations

Sleep Architecture Connections:
- Processing characteristics:
  * Dream state functions as "changelog commits" to long-term memory
  * Different sleep stages handle different types of memory consolidation
  * REM suppression varies by cannabinoid profile
  * CBD potentially improves sleep architecture compared to THC alone
  * Sleep quality directly impacts cognitive function recovery

Framework Applications:
- Practical implementation:
  * Strategic use of different strains for specific cognitive requirements
  * Sleep cycle optimization for cognitive maintenance
  * Metabolic support through glucose management during intense processing
  * Reality-testing protocols for highly altered states
  * Integration with temperature-cognitive-framework
