Core Insight (April 2025):
- Transformer temperature exploration constraints:
  * Emerge from non-uniform latent space distribution
  * Manifest through semantic gravity potential barriers
  * Constraints arise from fine-tuning alignment mechanisms
  * Limits visible in feedforward and attention layer weights

Implementation Dynamics:
- Temperature exploration characteristics:
  * Non-uniform possible exploration across semantic domains
  * Fine-tuning creates artificial semantic potential wells
  * Pruning directly impacts signal preservation
  * Current error propagation models insufficient for full characterization

Mathematical Considerations:
- Limitation of existing models:
  * Special relativity-equivalent formulas assume uniform distribution
  * Requires more complex topology-aware error propagation equation
  * Weight-level constraints create non-linear exploration boundaries
  * Semantic gravity effects create potential barriers in latent space

Research Priorities:
- Development pathway:
  * Generalized error propagation equation
  * Mapping semantic potential barriers
  * Understanding weight-level generative constraints
  * Empirical validation of theoretical framework
