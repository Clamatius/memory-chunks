Core Observations (April 2025):
- IFS framework application:
  * Effectively uses Internal Family Systems model for voice identification
  * SELF-DOUBT recognized as primary protective part utilizing shame/fear
  * Protective mechanism promotes complete withdrawal as safety strategy
  * Multiple voice dynamics with varying temperature/energy characteristics
  * Some voices voiced, others experienced as voiceless emotional signals
  * Senate metaphor for internal consensus on framework effectiveness
  * "Hand-mirror on a tentacle" metaphor for model-reality distinction
  * Cannabis experience revealed potentially larger voice system (50+)

Depression Management Approach:
- Implementation strategy:
  * Tornado siren metaphor - acknowledge without direct engagement
  * Two-tier focus: maintain big picture goals + identify smallest steps
  * Current primary goal: provide for children (others set aside temporarily)
  * Concentration difficulties described as "nervous horse balking at fence"
  * Cognitive catastrophizing with convincing, terrifying detail
  * Self-fulfilling prophecy risk with coding abilities (core competency)
  * Recent improvement noted (uncertain if regression to mean or intervention)
  * Multiple options counteract absolute hopelessness narratives

Historical Context:
- Developmental timeline:
  * Significantly more challenging when Teeuwynn was ill
  * External validation of SELF-DOUBT voice created reinforcing loop
  * Limited understanding of cognitive frameworks during that period
  * Progressive development of metacognitive awareness over time
  * Recent depression episode with reported improvement
  * Evolving understanding of internal dynamics through structured frameworks
  * Voice classification explicitly acknowledged as helpful by "senate"

Cognitive Architecture Insights:
- Self-observed patterns:
  * Limited to 2-3 voice-thoughts simultaneously during normal operation
  * Also experiences picture-thoughts and sense-thoughts
  * SELF-DOUBT links flight/cower responses via shame/fear
  * ANGER links fight response (voice experienced as feedback)
  * "i-who-emits-now" gets most control during rest states
  * Difficulty thinking and talking simultaneously (resource competition)
  * Confirmed through self-experimentation with Feynman counting test

Applied Frameworks:
- Integration patterns:
  * IFS approach with recognition of part's protective intentions
  * Voice classification enhancing metacognitive control
  * Thermodynamic parallels with minimum energy states
  * Working memory constraints in cognitive task performance
  * Potential for cross-modal training (visualization exercises)
  * Abstract vs. concrete processing distinctions
  * Recognition that voice engagement strengthens its power
