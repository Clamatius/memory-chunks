Core Insight (April 2025):
- Information transcoding mechanics:
  * All information consists of {encoding, signal} pairs
  * Transcoding between encodings often incurs information loss
  * Native languages exist for different systems (thought for humans, embeddings for LLMs)
  * Multiple transcoding steps create cascading loss patterns
  * Signal modifications include both loss and unintended additions

Husk Concept Development:
- Definition and mechanics:
  * Husk: Information in Mn not present in M1 (where M1→M2→...→Mn represents transcoding chain)
  * Husks serve both protective and distortive functions
  * Protective husks: Metadata enabling successful transmission (e.g., HTTP headers)
  * Distortive husks: Artifacts and noise introduced during transcoding
  * Optimization requires balancing husk functionality against overhead

Implementation Patterns:
- Cross-system communication:
  * Human thought → language → text → LLM embeddings (and reverse)
  * Each boundary represents potential information loss
  * Parsers function as receiver-transcoders between systems
  * Puppet models serve as native-language approximations of other systems
  * Puppets minimize internal transcoding loss but suffer from initial creation loss

Theoretical Framework:
- Transcoding optimization:
  * Traditional focus on bit-reduction (compression efficiency)
  * Alternative focus on signal fidelity relative to transmission cost
  * Fundamental impossibility of lossless thought transmission
  * Energy costs for transcoding creating thermodynamic constraints
  * Mathematical modeling potential for optimizing signal-husk balance

Cross-Framework Integration:
- Conceptual connections:
  * Fruit-seed metaphor: Husks provide protective structure for core information
  * Search-tentacle model: Puppets as transcoder approximations in native space
  * Thermodynamic operators: Energy costs of information preservation and transfer
  * Quantum consciousness: Discrete processing steps as transcoding points
  * Shannon information theory: Rate-distortion theory generalized to cross-encoding transfers
